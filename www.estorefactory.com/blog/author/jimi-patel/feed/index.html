<p><b>Define your goal:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before you start creating your Sponsored Display video ad, you need to define your goal. What do you want to achieve with your ad? Do you want to increase sales, improve brand awareness, or showcase new products? Once you define your goal, you can create an ad that aligns with your objective.</span></p>
<p><b>Understand your audience: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create an effective Sponsored Display video ad, you must understand your target audience. Who are they, what are their interests, and what motivates them to make a purchase? Once you understand your audience, you can create an ad that resonates with them and increases the likelihood of a sale.</span></p>
<p><b>Keep it short and sweet:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sponsored Display video ads should be short. Amazon recommends that videos should be no longer than 30 seconds. Focus on showcasing the most important features of your product or service, and make sure the video is visually appealing.</span></p>
<p><b>Showcase your product:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sponsored Display video ads are an excellent way to showcase your product. Make sure your video highlights the benefits of your product and how it can solve your customers&#8217; problems. Show your product in action and demonstrate how it works.</span></p>
<p><b>Include a call-to-action:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your Sponsored Display video ad should include a call-to-action. Encourage viewers to click on your product or learn more about your brand. Make sure the call to action is clear and concise.</span></p>
<p><b>Use high-quality visuals and audio:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sponsored Display video ads should be visually appealing and have high-quality audio. Use clear images and videos that showcase your product in the best possible light. Make sure the audio is clear and easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><b>Test and optimize: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your Sponsored Display video ad is live, it&#8217;s important to test and optimize it. Monitor the performance of your ad and make changes as needed. Experiment with different video lengths, visuals, and calls to action to see what works best for your brand.</span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place inventory orders for upcoming key sale days and events.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review your sales data.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep on optimizing your listings and identify the scope for improvements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask your Amazon advertising agency to make adjustments to your <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-advertising-agency/">Amazon PPC strategy.</a></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail holidays and key sale events are an excellent opportunity for brands to engage shoppers and drive sales.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can&#8217;t prepare for all of these sales events on your marketing calendar, choose a few specific holidays that fit your Amazon business. If you don&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of planning for the whole year, let <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon consultants</a> at eStore Factory handle it for you.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year Amazon introduced the Manage Your Customer Engagement tool, which gave sellers an opportunity to communicate directly with the customers who opt to &#8220;follow&#8221; their brand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the recent Accelerate event, Amazon introduced three new audience types for the Manage Your Customer Engagement tool. The new Tailored Audiences allows sellers to communicate and build lasting relationships with customers who have purchased from their brand in the last 12 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll take a closer look at the new Tailored Audiences tool and how sellers can include it in their post-purchase strategy.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Amazon Tailored Audiences?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1680" height="876" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-84350" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants.jpeg" alt="amazon seller consultant" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants.jpeg 1680w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-300x156.jpeg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-1024x534.jpeg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-768x400.jpeg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-1536x801.jpeg 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-500x261.jpeg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-800x417.jpeg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-1280x667.jpeg 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-1568x818.jpeg 1568w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-Amazon-seller-consultants-600x313.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Tailored Audiences is available as an expansion to the Manage Your Customer Engagement, an email-marketing tool that allows sellers to increase their reach and build meaningful relationships with their customers. Launched last year, the Manage Your Customer Engagement tool provides brands with multiple plug-and-play templates to share news of new product launches, inform customers about ongoing deals and inspire repeat purchases among their followers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, brands using the customer engagement tool could market to only one segment of their customer base: brand followers (shoppers who opt to &#8220;follow&#8221; their stores).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the introduction of Tailored Audiences, brands can expand their reach beyond brand followers. They can send emails to the following three types of customers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Repeat customers: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers who have purchased from you more than once in the past 12 months.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Recent customers: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent 20% of customers who have purchased from your brand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>High-spending customers: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highest spending 25% of your brand&#8217;s customers in the last 12 months.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tailored Audiences feature easy-to-use campaign templates and customer segmentation capabilities that allow brands to engage existing customers through personalized campaigns. This new feature gives brands the ability to leverage email marketing. Brands can build attractive email marketing campaigns and monitor their performance using metrics like open rate, click-through rate, emails delivered, opt-out rate, sales, and conversion. </span></p>
<h2><b>Who can use Amazon Tailored Audiences?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Tailored Audience feature is still in beta and will be available to all brand-registered US sellers in the next six months. There has been no announcement made for the global launch of the Tailored Audiences feature, so EU sellers might have to wait a bit more.</span></p>
<p><b>To be eligible for the program, sellers must:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be brand registered for more than 12 months.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have sent 10 or more customer engagement campaigns with at least 1000 total emails sent.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have an average opt-out-to-click rate of less than 1% over the last 10 customer engagement campaigns.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To access Tailored Audiences, go to Brands &gt; Customer Engagement in Seller Central.</span></p>
<h2><b>How do Tailored Audiences work?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Customer Engagement&#8217;s Tailored Audiences, you can select from the four audiences of customers to receive your email campaigns: repeat customers, high-spend customers, recent customers, and brand followers. You can also schedule the campaigns to run for a specific audience every 7 to 14 days, depending on the audience&#8217;s &#8220;campaign frequency.&#8221; Brands can schedule an unlimited number of emails at a time, but the frequency of customers receiving the emails is limited. </span></p>

<h2><b>Email campaign setup</b></h2>
<p><b>Step 1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select a shopping event. Selecting a theme for your email will give your email an attractive and eye-catching header. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select the featured product. Your email campaign can highlight new products or ongoing promotions. Enter the ASIN of your primary product and the option to add promo details will pop up if available. Please note that promos must be created 24 hours before your campaign setup and have an end date of 6 days or more from your campaign start date.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a supporting lifestyle image that explains the benefits and USPs of your product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add supporting products. You can add up to four supporting products per campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schedule the campaign. Your campaign will be sent within the 5-day period. Keep in mind that Amazon may take about 72 hours to approve the campaign. </span></p>

<h2><b>How to measure the performance of the Tailored Audiences campaign?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-84352" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-New-update-to-tailored-audiences.jpg" alt="Amazon FBA management services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-New-update-to-tailored-audiences.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-New-update-to-tailored-audiences-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-New-update-to-tailored-audiences-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-New-update-to-tailored-audiences-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-New-update-to-tailored-audiences-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-New-update-to-tailored-audiences-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3-New-update-to-tailored-audiences-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon offers a variety of metrics that helps brands monitor and optimize the performance of their email marketing campaigns. Here are the ones you and your </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seller-account-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon seller account manager </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">need to focus on:</span></p>
<p><b>1) Open rate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indicates the number of customers who opened your email. Observe which emails have the best open rates: discount emails, new product launch emails, or emails with coupon code. You might want to send those emails more often. </span></p>
<p><b>2) Click-through rate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indicates the number of customers who clicked the links you included in your email campaign. The higher the click-through rate, the better will be your engagement and conversion rate. </span></p>
<p><b>3) Opt-out rates: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indicates the number of customers who opt out of your email marketing campaigns. To keep your opt-out rate low, do not send spammy or overflowing emails to your customers. Always send an email that provides value to your customers. </span></p>
<p><b>4) Sales and conversion rate: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These metrics are a direct indicator of your email marketing success. They show how much sales you&#8217;ve generated from your campaign.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why did Amazon launch Tailored Audiences?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, brands have been looking for new ways to build lasting relationships with their customers. Since the piloting of the new Manage Your Customer Engagement tool, sellers have asked for new capabilities to reach customers. This is what led Amazon to introduce Tailored Audiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon also understands the importance of remarketing. Along with finding new customers, it is equally important to build a lasting and profitable relationship with existing customers, and email marketing is a powerful way to do this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benjamin Hartman, the vice president of Amazon North America Selling Partner Services, said, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brands are able to quickly acquire new customers in the Amazon store, but they expressed a need for improved tools to increase customer lifetime value. These improvements help unlock the value of remarketing as we further our commitment to helping sellers reach the right customer at the right time.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<h2><b>Best practices</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-84353" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-Amazon-seller-central-experts.jpg" alt="Amazon seller account management" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-Amazon-seller-central-experts.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-Amazon-seller-central-experts-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-Amazon-seller-central-experts-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-Amazon-seller-central-experts-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-Amazon-seller-central-experts-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-Amazon-seller-central-experts-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/4-Amazon-seller-central-experts-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Promote deals and new products as primary products</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and add a few best-selling products as supporting products.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Do not send more than one campaign per week. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also send educational emails to give your customers some variety. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create separate campaigns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for upcoming collections, discounted products, your latest release, coupon codes, etc.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Send emails at an appropriate time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sending emails late at night or early in the morning might not yield any visibility because they will be buried under other emails that stream later. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Add supporting images of other products</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from your catalog to create diversity and increase the chances of shoppers purchasing at least one of them. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Add lifestyles </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to pique the visual interest of your customers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Accompany your emails with a brand logo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You are not the only brand sending marketing emails, so adding a logo will help customers identify your brand. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Use metrics </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as open rate, click-through rates, emails delivered, opt-out rates, sales, and conversion to measure the impact of your email marketing campaigns. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Get help from a professional </b><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-creative-agency/"><b>Amazon creative agency</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to design and manage your email marketing campaigns. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Final thoughts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting repeat customers is an efficient way to drive repeat business and build a loyal customer base. By leveraging Tailored Audiences, brands can create strong and long-lasting relationships with their customers. Amazon is also planning to include custom HTML uploads and improved templates so brands can get even more creative with their email campaigns. </span></p>

<h2><b>What is the Amazon Influencer Program?</b></h2>
<h2><img decoding="async" width="2390" height="782" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-84116" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1.png" alt="amazon consulting agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1.png 2390w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-300x98.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-1024x335.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-768x251.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-1536x503.png 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-2048x670.png 2048w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-500x164.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-800x262.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-1280x419.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-1920x628.png 1920w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-1568x513.png 1568w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1-600x196.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2390px) 100vw, 2390px" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Influencer Program is Amazon&#8217;s attempt to tap into the lucrative influencer marketing space, which has become one of the fastest and most effective ways for brands to reach relevant audiences. Similar to Amazon Associates program, influencers earn commission on sales they bring to Amazon. </span></p>
<h2><b>How does the Amazon Influencer Program work?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-84115" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-4.jpg" alt="amazon consulting services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-4.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-4-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-4-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-4-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-4-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-4-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-4-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) An influencer/content creator builds an army of strong, loyal followers on their social media accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) The content creator/influencer gets enrolled into the program, goes through the approval process and verifies the account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) They open their customized store on Amazon and partner with an </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-creative-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon creative agency </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or brands to promote their products on the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4) Once a shopper makes a purchase, the influencer gets a commission and the seller receives rewards in the form of increased sales and brand awareness. </span></p>
<h2><b>How does the Amazon Influencer Program differ from the Amazon Associate Program</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Influencer Program is the extension of the Amazon Associates program, an affiliate marketing program where anyone with an authentic website can promote products and earn commissions on sales earned through those links.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between both programs is that while the Amazon Associates program is geared toward website owners and bloggers, the Influencer Program is intended for content creators with a large, loyal following on their social media accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Amazon Associates Program, participants can only share affiliate product links on their website and social media program, whereas, in the Influencer Program, content creators can create their own <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/">storefronts on Amazon</a>. This allows their followers to view all of the influencer&#8217;s recommendations at once. Influencers&#8217; storefronts can be categorized for easy navigation and come with a custom link they can post on their social media accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The qualification and eligibility criteria are also different for Amazon Associates Program and Influencer Program. To qualify for the Amazon Associates Program, all you need is an authentic website or blog. The qualifications required to enter Amazon Influencer Program are more stringent &#8211; Amazon will authenticate and analyze your social media accounts (Instagram, Youtube, and Facebook), your follower engagement, post count and post consistency, among other factors, to determine if you are fit for the program. </span></p>
<h2><b>Benefits of influencer marketing</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-84114" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-4.jpg" alt="Benefits of influencer marketing" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-4.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-4-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-4-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-4-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-4-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-4-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-4-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing has seen unprecedented growth in the past few years. A strategy that was once considered a fad by many has taken the marketing world by storm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s virtually impossible to scroll through your Instagram feed without seeing any product being promoted by influencers. This is because, with influencer marketing, brands can promote the right products at the right time to the right audience. At this point, there is no denying the effectiveness of influencer marketing. The stats below will show why investing in influencer marketing is a no-brainer:</span></p>

<h2><b>How can Amazon sellers find and connect with influencers?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-84113" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-4.jpg" alt="How can Amazon sellers find and connect with influencers?" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-4.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-4-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-4-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-4-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-4-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-4-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-4-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right influencer takes some leg work. Our team of </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon marketing consultants </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">has listed simple steps that&#8217;ll help you find and partner with the right influencer for your brand. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 1: Determine your goals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you begin your hunt for the right influencer for your brand, be sure to determine your influencer marketing campaign goal and understand your product lineup. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 2: Check your store</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&#8217;t have positive seller ratings, or you sell products with a lot of critical reviews, no influencer is going to risk their reputation promoting your products. Your brand needs to be trustworthy and your product should be worth promoting. Once you&#8217;ve established that, you can continue your search for influencers.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 3: Search for relevant content creators and influencers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you sell yoga pants, you need a fitness or lifestyle influencer. There can be some crossover between niches, but you want to make sure that the influencer&#8217;s niche audience would be interested to know about your product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visit popular social media sites like Instagram or Facebook and search for keywords or hashtags related to your product. If the influencer is already a member of the Amazon Influencer Program, Amazon&#8217;s algorithm will suggest relevant influencers to promote your brand and products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands can also find influencers using Amazon Live. Head to the </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/live"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page and find the influencers who are frequently promoting products like yours on Amazon live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands should do their homework while searching for influencers. It&#8217;s a huge undertaking and should not be rushed with. There are a lot of imposters who claim to be influencers, but most of their followers are paid. Ask your </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/account-management-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon management agency </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to look at the engagement on their social media handles, look at the brands they have worked with in the past and make sure to validate every influencer you work with. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 4: Get in touch with micro-influencers of your niche</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We suggest not to target big celebrities or influencers with millions of followers because they tend to have a lower engagement rate and can also be extremely expensive to partner with. Instead, team up with a micro-influencer from your niche. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micro-influencers are super-specific influencers who might have fewer followers (&lt;100K), but their engagement rate is very high. Micro-influencers are mostly from humble backgrounds, making them more relatable and approachable. They are also more likely to reply to comments and DMs, so when a micro-influencer posts about your product, their audience will be interested and would want to learn more. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 5: Pitch them your offer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;ve identified the influencer you’d like to work with, list out the points why they should promote your product and what benefit they would receive. Don&#8217;t immediately reach out to them with a contract or endorsement. Take things slow and establish a genuine relationship with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also send them some of your products for free, so they can try them out themselves and give their authentic review. No matter who you participate with, ensure they are genuinely interested in your product because the audience can tell whether the post is inauthentic and the influencer is saying these things because they are paid for it. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 6: Keep on experimenting</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the influencer has agreed to work with your brand and signed the agreement, start designing a customized influencer marketing campaign. Below we&#8217;ve listed some of the most popular campaign ideas that will help drive traffic to your Amazon listing</span></p>
<p><b>1) Create sponsored post</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with #ad or #sponsored hashtags. For this type of post, let the influencer create content on their own, so it nicely blends in with their feed and does not look inauthentic.</span></p>
<p><b>2) Host a giveaway.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Engagement and conversion rates for giveaways are typically high because the audience looks forward to winning a free product. Giveaways can also help you increase your brand&#8217;s social following.</span></p>
<p><b>3) Offer discount codes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Provide influencers with a custom discount code to share with their followers. Since the code is custom-made for the influencer, it will make their audience feel special and they&#8217;ll most likely use it. </span></p>
<p><b>4) Conduct a live stream on Amazon.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Livestream shopping is getting popular day by day as Amazon sellers are experiencing dramatically fewer returns. To create urgency and increase the likelihood of customers purchasing the product from the live stream, give the influencers a discount code that they can share with their live stream audience. </span></p>
<h2><b>When should you use influencer marketing?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-84112" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-4.jpg" alt="amazon consulting agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-4.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-4-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-4-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-4-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-4-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-4-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-4-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some niches in which influencer marketing works particularly well:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Beauty</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Health and fitness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) Toys</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4) Electronics</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5) Lifestyle</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6) Travel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your products fall under any of these categories, partnering with an influencer can prove to be profitable for your brand. </span></p>
<h2><b>Over to you</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing is here to stay. Brands selling in beauty, health, lifestyle, fitness and electronics are more likely to see better return on investment because these are the areas where customers rely on influencers&#8217; opinions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers with strong social media presence can also become influencers using the Amazon Influencer Program and earn commission by promoting their own products! </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a marketplace so cut-throat, Amazon sellers need every edge they can get to stand out. In the past, any seller could achieve measurable success just by uploading a few white background product shots and adding a couple of taglines to poorly designed Enhanced Brand Content. Today, however, the competition is growing fiercer with every minute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers need to make consistent efforts to be seen, heard and remembered because customers are deliberately scrutinizing the origin of every product they&#8217;d like to buy. That&#8217;s why building a brand is becoming business-critical. It&#8217;s no longer a task you can keep pushing to the bottom of your to-do list. </span></p>
<h2><b>Branding matters. Here&#8217;s why</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83594" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-1.jpg" alt="Amazon sellers consultant" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-1-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-1-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-1-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-1-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-1-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/01-1-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With millions, if not billions trying to make their presence felt on the over-saturated Amazon marketplace, having a strong brand can truly make a difference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you sell in a competitive category, the space for communicating your brand values and ethics is limited because it&#8217;s also given to each and every one of your competitors. You are most likely competing against businesses that, on the surface, are selling exactly the same thing. So the brand you build is actually the only real differentiator between your products and the competing products. Your brand values, ethics and voice are unique to you, so they give you a competitive edge and allow you to capitalize on what sets you apart from everyone else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always remember that by selling products, you generate customers, but by building a brand, you create advocates. If you want the customers to keep coming back to you and new customers to find you, don&#8217;t just focus on selling products; build a brand. </span></p>
<h2><b>Most overlooked branding opportunities </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After working with Amazon sellers for the past seven years, we&#8217;ve realized that most of them are unaware of the excellent branding opportunities the platform presents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon gives businesses plenty of opportunities to establish themselves as brands customers can trust. The retail giant allows sellers to create their own store, promote their products and even provide protection for registered brands that are selling on their platform.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want your business to be a memorable brand on Amazon, it is going to take some work. Below we&#8217;ve listed some effective ways you can build a brand identity. Understanding them is simple; implementing them is another story. You can either DIY everything or hire an </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-creative-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon creative agency</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">like eStore Factory to do the job.</span></p>
<h2><b>Step 1: Understand what your brand is all about</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83596" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1.jpg" alt="brand building consultants for Amazon" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start building a brand, understand what you&#8217;ll be creating, who you&#8217;ll be creating it for and why you are creating it. Jot down on a piece of paper the products you sell, the categories you sell your product in and what you want to achieve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your customers should be able to resonate with what your brand has to offer. To do that, ask yourself the following questions:</span></p>
<p><b>Q1: Who is my target audience? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&#8217;t sell a product to a tween the same way you would to an adult. Learning who exactly your audience is essential. To determine your target audience, take a look at Google Analytics, social media insights, or website performance reports and analyze what age, demographic, location, or income group they belong to. </span></p>
<p><b>Q2: What are my target audience&#8217;s pain points? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step is to identify your target customer&#8217;s pain points and communicate how your product can help them solve them. A flashy logo or sales-inducing copy is really of no use if your product and brand do not address a customer&#8217;s pain points. </span></p>
<p><b>Q3: What makes my product unique?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is there anything different about your product? What can your product offer that others can&#8217;t? Knowing the difference between your product and competitor&#8217;s product is imperative to develop a successful brand. </span></p>
<p><b>Q4: What&#8217;s my brand&#8217;s mission and vision? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to have a clear, direct and an easy to comprehend mission + vision statement. In other words, know what your brand stands for. If you sell biodegradable waste bin bags, your brand&#8217;s mission and vision statements should be able to connect with eco-conscious customers.</span></p>
<h2><b>Step 2: Start adding branded elements to your creatives</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83597" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1.jpg" alt="graphic designers for Amazon sellers" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools like A+ Content, brand story and storefront are one of the best ways to increase the visual appeal of your brand. All of these tools are available to Amazon sellers globally and are free to use for all brand-registered sellers. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>A+ Content:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> According to Amazon, A+ Content encourages repeat purchases and increases sales by an average of 5%. Using A+ Content, brands can help customers make confident purchase decisions by proactively answering their questions, resulting in higher conversion rates, increased traffic, and increased sales when used effectively. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Brand story: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This newly launched feature helps brands connect with their customers by highlighting their unique story. The Brand Story feature creates a section separate from your product features in a dedicated slot of the detail page called &#8216;From the brand.&#8217;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/"><b>Amazon Brand Store</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This self-service feature helps brands create an immersive shopping experience for customers. It&#8217;s a place for customers to explore, interact, and shop from your brand in a single destination that is owned and maintained by you. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Video: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Amazon, 73% of US adults are more likely to purchase after watching a product video, 61% of global consumers say video is important in their purchase decision, and you can see up to 9.7% revenue increase when you add a video to your product listing. Your branded video can show how the product works, highlight the product&#8217;s unique features or display the brand&#8217;s mission and vision. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Step 3: Be more visible</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83598" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07_1.jpg" alt="amazon consulting agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07_1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07_1-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07_1-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07_1-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07_1-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07_1-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07_1-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of time, effort and finances go into creating a brand, but your work doesn&#8217;t end here. Getting your brand noticed is just as essential as creating the elements. Using tools like Posts, Amazon Live and Customer Engagement, brands can connect with existing shoppers and generate awareness among new-to-brand shoppers. Below we&#8217;ve explained each of these tools in brief:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-posts/"><b>Amazon Posts</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Posts come in handy when brands want to make the best of their high-quality visual assets, grow their follower base, or build an emotional connection with your brand. They appear in carousels on product detail pages, in content feeds for related products and categories, or on a dedicated page within your Store.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-live/"><b>Amazon Live</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live is available to all USA sellers with brand registry. It allows sellers to host high personality, full-of-energy live-streaming videos that reach Amazon shoppers at scale. Sellers can interact with shoppers in real time and even share promo codes to encourage on-the-spot purchases. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Customer Engagement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Customer Engagement is available in the US Amazon store to Brand Owners registered in the brand registry. Brands can send emails specifically for new product announcements and themed email campaigns around seasonally appropriate messages. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/"><b>Amazon Sponsored Ads</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With Sponsored Ads, brands can reach and connect with high intent shoppers on their customer journey. Sponsored Products can be used to drive awareness and discovery of a brand’s product portfolio within Amazon SERPs. Sponsored Brands can be used to build brand recall and affinity by displaying highly visual ads on the top pf SERPs and within the search results. Sponsored Display is for brands who want to reach relevant audiences across the shopping journey.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Step 4: Protect your brand </b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83600" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1.jpg" alt="Brand protection with Amazon brand registry" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon offers advanced tools to protect your brand in the marketplace. Brands can fight and block counterfeits, report violations, and establish automated protections to proactively remove suspected infringing or inaccurate content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programs such as Amazon Brand Registry, Transparency, IP Accelerator, Project Zero and Counterfeit Crimes Unit work together to shield your brand against counterfeits. We highly recommend brands register in each of these programs and take full advantage of the services they have to offer.</span></p>
<h2><b>Building a brand isn&#8217;t enough</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a brand does not make a product memorable. A brand that establishes itself must consistently deliver excellence, develop credibility among its competitors and build trust among its customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like any other aspect of marketing, brand building should be closely monitored so you can know what&#8217;s going right and what&#8217;s not. Leverage tools like Brand Analytics, Amazon Attribution and Manage Your Experiment to make an informed decision about your product portfolio and marketing activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Test, learn and keep on optimizing until you reach your goals. </span></p>
<h2><b>Don&#8217;t be just another &#8220;X&#8221; brand selling on Amazon</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your brand identity is being created, whether you are putting any effort into it or not. So why not consciously craft it with a thoughtful, intentional strategy that helps you stand out from the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping up with Amazon branding trends and taking in every branding initiative Amazon offers can feel like an uphill battle, but you don&#8217;t have to do it all alone. </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon consultants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at eStore Factory can help.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing sales for a product in a competitive category can seem like a stroke of luck, but it actually requires a series of consistent efforts. Take a moment to look at your product from a shopper&#8217;s viewpoint. Find out </span><b><i>who</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you are selling to, </span><b><i>why</i></b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the shopper should buy your product, </span><b><i>and how</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can reach more and more shoppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;ve found answers to these questions, start making an effort to reach your goals. </span></p>
<h2><b>#2: Focus on optimizing your listing copy and creatives for mobile shoppers</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83582" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02.jpg" alt="Mobile optimization for Amazon listings" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last holiday season, Amazon reported that customers shopped on Amazon mobile app nearly 70% more than the previous year, and the number is likely to increase in the coming years. If you haven&#8217;t already optimized your listing for mobile, you&#8217;re missing out. Here are a few simple hacks to ensure your listing is just as good looking on mobile as it is on desktop:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement digestible content. Break up lengthy paragraphs into shorter sentences, use more images and focus more on unique product features.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your title is no longer than 50 characters.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add more banners to your EBC because they display exceptionally well on smaller screens.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add images with less content and more visual elements to ensure readability.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>#3: Revitalize your content</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83584" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03.jpg" alt="Amazon listing optimization expert" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/03-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same old, same old won&#8217;t work. Resolve to give your existing content a facelift this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By content, we mean written as well as visual content. Quality content has a bigger impact on Amazon&#8217;s SEO and customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&#8217;t already have a fully optimized listing, hire </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon listing optimization </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">experts immediately. You want your detail page to be presentable, easily understandable, brimming with information and visible to anyone who&#8217;s looking for your product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already have an optimized listing ensure that your listing copy, images, A+ Content, brand story, storefront and even your Sponsored Brand custom creatives are in line with your branding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every creative touch point on Amazon should have the same fonts, a similar color palette and a familiar look and feel to give shoppers a cohesive experience. We highly recommend working with a professional </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-creative-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon creative agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can create designs that speak clearly to your brand personality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engage in continual A/B testing to determine what appeals to the customer. See whether a shorter title works better for your listing or a lengthier, keyword-rich title or if </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon A Plus Content </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with more infographics converts better or customers are inclined towards lifestyle images. </span></p>
<h2><b>#4: Utilize more dollars for video advertising</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83583" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04.jpg" alt="Amazon sponsored brand video ads creation" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video advertising should no longer be an afterthought. Gone are the days when Sponsored Brand Video ads were utilized by only niche sellers. In today&#8217;s crowded marketplace, even third-party sellers are creating excellent professional videos for their products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Sponsored Brand Video ads were first launched in early 2020, marketers believed it to be the future of Amazon advertising. But in 2023, it is the present. If you aren&#8217;t implementing video ads in your advertising strategy, you should immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon, too, is constantly making changes to Sponsored Brand Video ads. Clicking on the ads can now direct shoppers to brand stores, and Amazon also began playing branded videos in the SERPs. All of this means that you cannot just ignore the power video has to offer. </span></p>
<p><b>Tips for creating a video that leaves an impact</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your video product focused and show the product in the first few seconds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep it brief. Amazon suggests an optimal video length of 15–30 seconds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos play on mute so adding easily readable text captions is a no-brainer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure your target audience is present in the video. Do not just create a slideshow of infographic images. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>#5: Earn more reviews</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83576" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05.jpg" alt="How to get more reviews on Amazon" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviews and ratings are what fuel customer trust. They are the social proof that most customers base their decision on. Customer reviews also strengthen your product&#8217;s organic position. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With reviews being so vital for a product&#8217;s performance, it makes complete sense to include them in your New Year&#8217;s resolution. However, we do not recommend resorting to not-so-legitimate methods of acquiring reviews. Below, we&#8217;ve listed some failproof white hat tricks to get more reviews for your product:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Amazon&#8217;s request a review button. It sends an email to the customer requesting a product review. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in an automated review tool like Feedback Five, Jungle Scout, or Viral Launch to ask for reviews. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enroll your product in the Amazon Vine program.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create product inserts that ask for reviews in a neutral way. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>#6: Find an alternative to FBA</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83580" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06.jpg" alt="inventory management for Amazon sellers" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon&#8217;s continued struggle with warehouse capacity is not news. During Q4 2022, Amazon had hit sellers with a series of severe inventory limits, which can restrict the number of products you can send to the warehouse. Amazon also charged a 2022 Holiday Peak Fulfillment Fee of 35 cents USD per item for all orders placed between October 15, 2022, to January 14, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this suggests that Amazon is in a space crunch and it&#8217;s not an easy fix. Instead of waiting for Amazon to fix their warehouse issues, we suggest sellers come up with an alternative to FBA. You can use a third-party logistics provider to store your stock and manage fulfillment. However, this does not mean that you abandon FBA entirely. Consider a hybrid model where you can easily switch to another service provider when you face any challenges with Amazon&#8217;s fulfillment network. </span></p>
<h2><b>#7: Explore and expand your horizons</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83579" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07.jpg" alt="amazon consulting agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being the most lucrative e-commerce marketplace to sell on, it&#8217;s hard to stand out on Amazon. That&#8217;s why more and more sellers are diversifying their selling channels and lessening their dependency on the retail giant. Relying on Amazon alone can be detrimental to your brand and there&#8217;s always a risk associated with keeping all your eggs in one basket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey conducted by Feedvisor states that more than 50% of merchants in the USA also sell on eBay, about one in three merchants sell on Walmart and close to half sell on their own websites in addition to Amazon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can partner with a full-service </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon eCommerce agency</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">like eStore Factory to expand your presence across other marketplaces. We have strategies and years of experience to help you optimize and manage products across various platforms, as well as the capability and capacity for managing multiple fulfillment strategies.</span></p>
<h2><b>#8: Invest in the best talent</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83577" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08.jpg" alt="Hire best Amazon consultant for seller central and vendor central" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/08-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t DIY. As you find your Amazon business growing, you&#8217;ll also find yourself needing extra hands to manage it. Instead of doing it all on your own and failing, it is better to outsource it to an agency and the people who actually know how Amazon works. Finding the right </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amz-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon agency</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can have a positive impact on your bottom line and stress levels, so don&#8217;t shy away from spending some extra dollars. </span></p>

</ul>
<h2><b>How to keep up with your resolutions?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a series of self-improving, life-changing and mood-boosting things going around, there is no shortage of motivation and enthusiasm during the first few weeks of the year. However, come the first week of February, most of us bail out and settle into our old patterns. According to research from the University of Scranton, only 8% of people can actually achieve their New Year&#8217;s goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, you can defy those odds and actually achieve what you set out to do at the beginning of the year. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t just make resolutions. Make an action plan and stick to it. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Break down your yearly goals into monthly, weekly and daily goals. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not multitask; tackle one goal at a time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treat yourself to every goal achieved</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement proper time management techniques to smooth out the wrinkles and build a healthy structure amid the chaos</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you encounter a setback, view them as learning opportunities</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Make waves in 2023</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There you have it. With these resolutions, you can ring in the new year with a bang. So, take some time out to crunch the numbers, find out what is and isn&#8217;t working for you, modify your strategy according to these resolutions and 2023 will just be as &#8211; if not more &#8211; successful than 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From our team to yours, wish you a happy and successful New Year! We wish you kick off the New Year with excellent account health, increased sales and a booming bottom line. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a successful Q4 follows a wave of returns. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer returns are part and parcel of the Amazon selling journey. In order to provide a great shopping experience to customers, Amazon makes it a breeze for buyers to return the products. While hassle-free returns enhance buyers&#8217; experience, they lead to serious headaches for sellers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returns and refunds dramatically magnify after the holidays. In a study conducted by Oracle, a staggering 42% of holiday shoppers revealed that they already plan on returning some, if not all, of their holiday gifts. And 46% of them, if faced with a poor return experience, vow never to shop from the seller again. </span></p>
<h2><b>Why is handling post-holiday returns so daunting?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83509" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon product listing optimization" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sheer volume of returns and refund requests that pop up after the holidays contributes to the difficulty. Amazon sellers are used to handling returns on a daily basis, but during the post-holiday period, returns and refunds reach record numbers. Since the wave of returns tails right after the holiday season ends, it feels like the business is not getting a break. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Amazon extends the return window ahead of holidays which makes things even more complicated. The new return policy states that most items purchased between October 7, 2022, and December 31, 2022, are returnable until January 31, 2023. This roughly four-month-long return window creates greater opportunities for return fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returns and refunds are always a friction point for sellers and</span> <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seller-account-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While you can do nothing to stop the returns from flowing in, you can take steps to mitigate the damage. Enforcing a robust return policy will not only ensure good standing with Amazon but will also help establish a trustworthy brand reputation. </span></p>
<p><b>Below our </b><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/"><b>Amazon ​seller central consultants </b></a><b>have listed actionable tips to help you streamline the post-holiday return rush. </b></p>
<h2><b>#1: Identify the root cause of returns</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83508" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon product listing services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-2-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve a healthy performance metric, Amazon recommends that you maintain a return of less than 10% of your yearly sales. That&#8217;s why you must identify the root cause of items that are frequently returned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start scouring through the seller feedback and customer reviews section of the listing to find out the factors that could have contributed to a negative customer experience. It can be anything from late delivery of the product to incorrect product description. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers can also go to Reports &gt; Fulfillment &gt; Customer concessions &gt; Returns in their seller accounts to find out the exact reason why the product was returned. Another way to find the reason for returned items is by opening a ticket with seller support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you know the reason, determine if the return reason is controllable or uncontrollable. Controllable reasons include improper packaging, delayed deliveries, lack of accurate information, etc. As the name suggests, uncontrollable reasons are not in your hands; for example, a customer changes their mind and decides they don&#8217;t want the product anymore. </span></p>
<h2><b>#2: Maintain a list of all the return email notifications you receive</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83507" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon product listing optimization services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it may sound like an extra task added to your to-do list, it is absolutely essential to keep a record of all the return email notifications you receive from Amazon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a Prime customer returns the product, Amazon immediately issues a refund without waiting to collect the item from the shopper&#8217;s house. Maintaining a list of all the return emails will help you verify if the item was actually returned to the warehouse or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also track the returns from the returns section in the reports tab of your Seller Central account. The report shows a list of refunded products. You can search in your FBA inventory to track the arrival of refunded items into the FBA warehouse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the item is not returned to the warehouse, you can ask Amazon for </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-fba-seller-reimbursements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FBA reimbursement.</span></a></p>
<h2><b>#3: Initiate damage control</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there&#8217;s something that hurts more than a refund, it&#8217;s gotta be negative reviews and seller feedback. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, customers leave a negative review or critical seller feedback after they request a refund. Although Amazon has removed the capability to comment and respond under review, sellers can still comment under seller feedback and personally apologize for a customer&#8217;s bad shopping experience.</span></p>
<h2><b>#4: Promote exchange instead of return </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a shopper is returning the product just because they don&#8217;t like the color or the size is incorrect, encourage them to exchange the product instead of returning it. </span></p>
<h2><b>#5: Personally inspect returned items</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83506" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon listing optimization services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the returned item arrives back at the FBA center, a warehouse worker inspects the item to see if the item is fulfillable or unfulfillable. If the packaging has been opened, it will be marked as &#8220;customer damaged&#8221; and won&#8217;t be sent back for selling. Similarly, if the item was returned as &#8220;Defective&#8221; by the customer, it won&#8217;t be eligible for selling. If the FBA worker determines that the item hasn&#8217;t been opened and the packaging isn&#8217;t damaged, it will be added back to your sellable inventory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the process seems near-perfect, it is too dependent on the warehouse worker inspecting your product. The workers do their job at top speed and chances are that they might miss something crucial in their inspection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always a good idea to get all the returned items sent back to you before they are available for selling. Even a minute defect in packaging or a missing guarantee card can put off customers and result in a negative experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your catalog consists of hundreds of products, it might not be feasible to get all the returned items sent back to you, so we recommend you do this for products with frequent and higher numbers of returns. </span></p>
<h2><b>#6: Be proactive and avoid having returns</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prevention is better than a cure!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it is impossible to have zero returns, you can take steps to drastically reduce the number of returns post-holiday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most customers return the items because the product does not meet their expectations. Their expectations are based on how you describe and display the product on the detail page. So, double-check your listing to ensure everything written and every image uploaded is accurate. Ensure there are no size distortions, vague language, or boastful text. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately rectify anything that can create inaccurate expectations in the minds of a customer. </span></p>
<h2><b>Are you prepared to brave the wave of post-holiday returns?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a proactive approach to managing returns will establish a positive brand reputation, reduce future returns and increase your FBA credit. Implement these tips in your post-holiday return management strategy and reap the benefits of streamlining the return process.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q4 can be exhilarating and lucrative, but it does not last all year. The New Year is underway, and as the holiday season starts wrapping up, customer behavior changes and so does sales velocity. Therefore brands need a strategy to enter the New Year with a bang. Your Q4 sales may not rival Q1 sales, but you can implement a well-thought action plan to surpass last year&#8217;s Q1 sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we&#8217;ve listed a few tips that can help brands prepare their Amazon store for the Q1 aftermath. </span></p>
<h2><b>#1: Perform a gap analysis and establish a roadmap</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83471" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon seller consulting agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you hit the ground running, don&#8217;t forget to look into the rearview mirror. Take a look back at what your brand has accomplished in the past four quarter(s). Ask your</span> <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seller-account-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon expert </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to scour through all of the data, from new-to-brand sales to conversion rates and dig deep to look for spikes, dips, and anomalies. The answers you need to avoid pitfalls in the coming years can be found hidden in the path you&#8217;ve already traveled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t get too hung up on failures but make a list of corrective actions that need to be taken. Based on that, devise a strategy to achieve goals for the first quarter of the year. Planning is crucial because it helps businesses take stock of what goals have been achieved so far and what can be achieved in the coming year. Just be sure to smooth out the kinks and you will be ready for whatever 2023 has in store for you. </span></p>
<h2><b>#2: Tone down your ad bids and daily budget</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83470" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon seller consulting" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we get closer to the New Year, conversion rates decline. When transitioning from Q4 to Q1, the first step should be to cut down on advertising spend. We recommend you gradually start to lower your bids after Christmas and normalize back to how they were before the holidays by New Year.</span></p>
<h2><b>#3: Remove holiday-related keywords from your listing</b></h2>
<h2><b><img decoding="async" width="2214" height="742" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83473" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3.png" alt="amazon seller consulting services agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3.png 2214w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-300x101.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-1024x343.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-768x257.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-1536x515.png 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-2048x686.png 2048w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-500x168.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-800x268.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-1280x429.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-1920x643.png 1920w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-1568x525.png 1568w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-3-600x201.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2214px) 100vw, 2214px" /></b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keywords such as &#8220;best gift for Christmas&#8221; or &#8220;holiday gift for her&#8221; can be removed from your listing. Any gift-related keywords that are geared towards the holidays are good to use in Q4, but their use ceases to exist as we move into the New Year. Instead, </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-ads-specialist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon ad specialists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should shift their focus to best-performing keywords that have worked for you before. </span></p>
<h2><b>#4: Spin your products, so it fits into the &#8220;New Year, new me&#8221; spirit</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83469" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon seller consultant agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the New Year comes a wave of New Year&#8217;s resolutions. An effective way to keep the sales momentum going from Q4 to Q1 is to ensure that your products remain relevant enough to fit in a customer&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s resolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin your products and market them a bit differently, so your product line does not look out of place in the first quarter of the year. For example, if you are selling a dietary supplement that boosts energy, you can add a copy like &#8220;Take charge of your health this New Year!&#8221; to appeal to fitness-enthusiast shoppers. </span></p>
<h2><b>#5: Revert back to your original creatives</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="2116" height="748" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83474" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2.png" alt="amazon seller consultant" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2.png 2116w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-300x106.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-1024x362.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-768x271.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-1536x543.png 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-2048x724.png 2048w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-500x177.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-800x283.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-1280x452.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-1920x679.png 1920w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-1568x554.png 1568w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-2-600x212.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2116px) 100vw, 2116px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers usually dress their images for Q4 to get into the holiday spirit. Now that the holidays are over, you can edit them back to how they were. Remove any holiday-themed images, taglines and creatives from your advertising campaign, product detail page, and storefront.</span></p>
<h2><b>#6: Double down your marketing efforts if you are selling any fitness-related product</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83468" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-6-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon seller management services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-6-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-6-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-6-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-6-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-6-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-6-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-6-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are selling fitness, health, wellness, or self-care products, it is your time to shine. New Year&#8217;s resolution brings with it health kicks and an obsession to get fit and stay healthy. You can piggyback on the New Year attitude and pitch your products to fit into the &#8220;New Year, new me&#8221; mentality. </span></p>
<h2><b>#7: Stay on top of returns</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83467" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-7-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon seller account management services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-7-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-7-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-7-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-7-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-7-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-7-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-7-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the holidays, it is normal to see an increase in customer returns. According to a report, holiday returns account for 8% of all holiday sales. Instead of dreading returns, turn them into an opportunity to make lasting connections with your customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using FBA, there isn&#8217;t much you need to do. Amazon handles the entire process right from collecting the item from the shopper&#8217;s place to issuing a refund on your behalf. However, be sure to keep a record of return notification emails received from Amazon. When a customer initiates a refund of an item ordered via Prime shipping, Amazon immediately issues a refund without waiting for the item to be returned. We recommend sellers to keep track of refunds initiated vs. items returned to the warehouse to ensure everything&#8217;s in order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using FBM, be sure to polish your return policy so shoppers can have a hassle-free experience. Ask customers why they don&#8217;t want to keep your product. Their responses can be enlightening. You might be able to improve product quality or make minor fixes in the listing to reduce potential returns for the same reason. </span></p>
<h2><b>#8: Retarget your new-to-brand customers</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83466" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-8-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon seller consultant agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-8-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-8-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-8-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-8-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-8-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-8-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-8-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;ve done everything right, your brand might have seen an influx of new “followers”. Now is the time to do something with it. You can reconnect with shoppers who have already bought from you by leveraging tools like Manage Your Customer Engagement. You can send them emails about new product launches and upcoming discount offers to keep your brand on top of their mind in the New Year and beyond. Rather than letting your brand faze into the hazy holiday memories, make efforts to compel customers back to your Amazon store. </span></p>
<h2><b>#9: Fix what you couldn&#8217;t in Q4</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83465" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-9-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="Amazon consulting services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-9-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-9-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-9-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-9-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-9-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-9-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-9-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is growing and evolving at a breakneck speed. There&#8217;s so much to do and so little time. Now the Q4 shopping frenzy is over and everyone&#8217;s back at work, you&#8217;ll have plenty of time to revisit the things that you were too busy to deal with in Q4. Get those listings optimized, new </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-premium-a-plus-content/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium A+ Contents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created, storefronts built and images designed &#8211; you will have all the time in the world to fix and do everything you couldn&#8217;t during the Q4 shopping frenzy. </span></p>
<h2><b>#10: Don&#8217;t compare your Q1 with Q4</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="450" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83464" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-10-1140-x-450.jpg" alt="amazon seller consulting" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-10-1140-x-450.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-10-1140-x-450-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-10-1140-x-450-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-10-1140-x-450-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-10-1140-x-450-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-10-1140-x-450-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-10-1140-x-450-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q1 is an entirely different ballgame. Buyers don&#8217;t have the same spending power in Q4 as they do in Q1. So do not base your sales expectation on the last quarter. Instead of comparing it with Q4, you can compare it with 2022&#8217;s Q1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This outlook will keep your expectations in check and you will be able to set achievable goals for the coming quarter. </span></p>
<h2><b>What you do in the first quarter will set a precedent for the rest of the year</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting off on the right foot in the first quarter of a year can set your Amazon store up for success throughout the year. By taking all of these tips into consideration, you&#8217;ll be able to develop a robust post-holiday sales increase strategy for a smooth transition into the new quarter. If you&#8217;re finding it difficult to maintain the sales momentum into the New Year, we&#8217;re here to help.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A+ Content and Brand Story have become a norm (you should have already implemented both by now), so the next step to build your brand on Amazon is through a brand store. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article contains everything you need to know about storefronts. Read on to get answers to every question you have about Amazon Store.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is an Amazon Store?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1270" height="588" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83447" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-3.png" alt="Amazon storefront design" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-3.png 1270w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-3-300x139.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-3-1024x474.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-3-768x356.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-3-500x231.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-3-800x370.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/1-3-600x278.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon storefront</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also called a brand store, is a mini-me version of your website where shoppers can learn more about your brand and product line. Just like a website, it can have multiple pages that display your product categories. </span></p>
<h2><b>Who can create an Amazon Store?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store is a self-service product that is absolutely free to use for any seller or vendor enrolled in the brand registry program. </span></p>
<h2><b>How much does the Amazon Store cost?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store is completely free. You just need to be eligible to create a store and fulfill the requirements set by Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you want to create a store professionally, we recommend hiring an experienced </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-creative-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon creative agency </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do the job. </span></p>
<h2><b>Why should I invest in the Amazon Store?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up a store for your brand is no longer something you can keep pushing to the bottom of your to-do list. Instead, you see it as an investment that will keep generating dividends for years. Below we have listed a few reasons why every brand should invest in Amazon store:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store creates a branded destination for shoppers to explore your brand and product line.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a Store within Amazon allows you to piggyback on Amazon&#8217;s trustworthy brand name. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store is a place to foster brand awareness and build customer trust.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store helps you create a less generic and more memorable shopping experience. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store gives shoppers a sense of the brand&#8217;s narrative.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store helps you upsell and cross-sell by helping customers find more expensive versions or complementary sizes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store comes with its own customizable Amazon URL that makes it easy for you to share your store in your off-Amazon marketing campaigns.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How to create an Amazon Store?</b></h2>
<p><b>Step 1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to Stores &gt; Manage Stores. Once you do this, you will be redirected to the advertising console, where you will be shown a list of brands that qualify for store creation. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="2160" height="436" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83444" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1.png" alt="create a storefront on Amazon" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1.png 2160w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-300x61.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-1024x207.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-768x155.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-1536x310.png 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-2048x413.png 2048w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-500x101.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-800x161.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-1280x258.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-1920x388.png 1920w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-1568x317.png 1568w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2-1-600x121.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click &#8220;Create Store&#8221; and add your brand&#8217;s logo and meta description to set up your store. Amazon will display four different themes to pick from. We recommend choosing a blank template so you can customize your store as you want. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="2358" height="638" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83442" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2.png" alt="creating a storefront on Amazon" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2.png 2358w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-300x81.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-1024x277.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-768x208.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-1536x416.png 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-2048x554.png 2048w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-500x135.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-800x216.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-1280x346.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-1920x519.png 1920w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-1568x424.png 1568w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-2-600x162.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2358px) 100vw, 2358px" /></p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Establish your store&#8217;s home page and other pages by adding a variety of tiles. While creating a layout for your store, make sure it is easy to navigate so shoppers can find what they are looking for. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Populate the tiles using images, text and products. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Add product links to each tile. Click on the Store Preview option to see what your designed page is like. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 6: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now submit the store. Amazon will take about 24 hours to review the store. </span></p>
<h2><b>What are tiles in an Amazon Store?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each store page contains a customizable section of tiles. Each tile can include content such as text, images, videos, and products.</span></p>
<table border="1" width="100%">

<h2><b>What&#8217;s the approval process for the Amazon store?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every store must be submitted to Amazon for review and approval process. Just like your brand benefits from being associated with Amazon&#8217;s name, Amazon&#8217;s brand can be negatively impacted if a store on its website is not up to its high standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Amazon has created detailed </span><a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/resources/ad-policy/creative-acceptance" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creative acceptance policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure every store on Amazon is consistent and high quality. The review process can take up to 2-7 days, depending on how busy the team is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Store Insights offer clear metrics related to the performance of your store. Brands can check the daily visitors that view their store, the number of views a page receives in a day, sales that your products received from the visitors within 14 days of their last visit, traffic that your store receives and more. A metric called &#8220;Sources&#8221; shows how visitors found your store. By understanding how and from where the traffic came from, brands can optimize their ad campaigns and maximize store performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your store is up and running, you can also set up PPC campaigns and off-Amazon advertising campaigns to divert more and more traffic to your store. </span></p>
<h2><b>Are Amazon Stores mobile compatible?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Almost all the tiles available in the store look equally great on smaller screens as they do on desktops. </span></p>
<h2><b>How do I translate my Store for multilingual sites?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Amazon&#8217;s Stores support multiple languages and Amazon also provides translation. After your Store design has been submitted and approved, it will be translated within five business days. The translated version can be viewed using the standard language switcher in the navigation bar on the Amazon website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that text embedded in images and videos won&#8217;t be translated. If you want to translate your store into multiple languages, consider hiring professional </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon store design services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><b>Can I schedule </b><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/"><b>Amazon Store design</b></a><b> changes for holiday events?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Events like Halloween, Black Friday, Prime Day and Black Friday offer big sales opportunities for sellers, so tailoring your store is highly recommended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To dress up your store for various festivals and events, brands can use the Store version and schedule the store to run only for selected days. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use tiles like &#8220;bestsellers&#8221; and &#8220;recommended for you&#8221; to highlight products that interest the shoppers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a dedicated deals page that showcases the promotions and discounts running in your store. This page comes in handy during tentpole events like Prime Day and BFCM weekend. </span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Q4 almost coming to an end, it&#8217;s time for brands to get their 2023 selling plan in place. There are several factors that can help brands start the New Year with a bang. Now is the perfect time to analyze each tool and strategy in your wheelhouse to fuel growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are myriad ways to increase sales on Amazon, below we have listed actionable tips that are easy to implement and can be simply employed by brands of all sizes.</span></p>
<h2><b>#1: Learn from the past</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="500" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83284" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1.jpg" alt="amazon account management services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-1024x449.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-768x337.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-500x219.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-800x351.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1-600x263.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although you might want to bask in the glory of a profitable Q4 for the rest of Q1, it is important to look back and analyze everything that went well and everything that went south. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the root cause of campaigns or strategies that were unsuccessful. Find out what can be done to improve this year. If you had any fulfillment fails or advertising mishaps that happened during last year, be sure you have a contingency plan ready to prevent similar issues moving forward. </span></p>
<h2><b>#2: Make the most of all available tools</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="500" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83285" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1.jpg" alt="amazon seller account management services" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1-1024x449.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1-768x337.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1-500x219.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1-800x351.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-1-600x263.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most sellers are aware of the three cornerstones for success on Amazon: Appealing and informative product pages, pay-per-click campaigns, and lots of 5-star reviews. But over the years, the Amazon marketplace has dramatically changed. It’s not just enough to write compelling copy and earn 5-star reviews. There are so many recent tools and programs launched by Amazon that somewhat fly under the radar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon offers a suite of tools that are designed to aid customer-brand interaction. We have listed them below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-posts/"><b>Amazon Post</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Posts are social media-esque posts with an image and caption. By clicking on the Post, shoppers will be redirected to the product detail page, where they can directly purchase the advertised product. Posts have a dedicated page on the Amazon storefront and they are one of the best tools to increase brand following. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/amazon-manage-your-customer-engagement-tool-how-to-use-make-the-most-of-it/"><b>Manage Your Customer Engagement:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The MYCE tool helps brands measure the interactions and impressions with customers. When used correctly, it will help brands build strong and long-lasting relationships with shoppers who frequently purchase from them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-live/"><b>Amazon Live</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amazon Live allows brands to interact with shoppers in real-time through interactive live streams. As customers watch your live, they can also ask questions in the comments, redeem live-only promotions and buy products. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Brand dashboard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Are you curious about the terms shoppers use to find your product? Want to debug your sales funnel? Brand analytics dashboard gives brand-registered sellers access to valuable insights into their product portfolio and keyword ranking.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>#3: Drive off Amazon traffic to your listings</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="500" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83286" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3.jpg" alt="amazon account management agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-1024x449.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-768x337.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-500x219.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-800x351.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-600x263.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" />`</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving off-Amazon traffic should be at the top of your to-do list in 2023. By leveraging your social media, email platforms and Google ads, you can drive relevant traffic to your listing and get a chance to influence customers before any noise kicks in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend you enroll yourself in the Brand Referral Bonus Program if you haven&#8217;t already. With the BRB program, you get around a 10% bonus for every sale generated through off-Amazon traffic. </span></p>
<h2><b>#4: Prioritize optimizing your creatives</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1140" height="500" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83287" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4.jpg" alt="amazon account management services agency" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-300x132.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-1024x449.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-768x337.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-500x219.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-800x351.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-4-600x263.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands are quickly realizing the importance of investing in visually appealing creatives that speak to their brand. Apart from having a well-structured and informative title, bullet points and description, your listing should be attractive and eye-catching. Elements like images, A+ Content, and Stores can help brands stand out from the competition. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/"><b>A+ Content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven&#8217;t already invested in A+ Content, you are missing out. A+ Content is what compels the customers to stop and learn more about your product in highly competitive categories. It makes information easy to digest, helps reduce negative reviews and helps increase brand awareness. Recently Amazon rolled out Premium A+ Content to all brands that have successfully updated at least 15 A+ Contents in the past few months. If you are eligible, we highly recommend adding</span> <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/product/premium-a-page-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Premium A+ Content </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o your listing. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Images:</b> <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-photo-editing-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon listing images</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are one of the first things a shopper interacts with when they land on the detail page. They are located above the fold and are highly visible, so make sure they are worth seeing. Populate all the image fields with white background images showing the product from various angles, lifestyle images showing the product in use, and infographic images displaying the product&#8217;s key features.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with product detail page content, brands should also test prices, promotions, bundles and more. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review influences purchase decisions more than anything else. Amazon has stringent guidelines that prohibit sellers from manipulating shoppers for adding fake reviews, so make sure you use only white hat strategies to get more reviews. It’s completely okay to add an insert card into your packaging or send auto-generated messages asking for reviews as long as you do not sway customers or ask </span><b><i>only </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">for positive reviews.  </span></p>

<h2><b>#7: Focus on retention along with acquisition</b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&#8217;t want a leaky bucket. Along with acquiring new customers, make strategies to retain existing customers. One of the ways to increase sales from existing customers is by cross-selling other products from your brand. Amazon DSP can also be leveraged to target customers who have already bought from you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure customer retention, brands can stay in touch with the shoppers post-purchase. Offer services beyond what is expected to create opportunities for seamless upsell and downsell. </span></p>
