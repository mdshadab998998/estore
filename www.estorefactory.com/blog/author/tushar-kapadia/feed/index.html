										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Father&#8217;s Day sales numbers might not beat Mother&#8217;s Day, Easter or Valentine&#8217;s Day sales numbers, it&#8217;s still a major shopping holiday you can capitalize on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Father&#8217;s day 2022 falls on June 19th, Sunday, so the time to prep your Amazon store is now or never. We&#8217;ve listed a few last-minute tweaks brands can make to their Amazon strategy to gear up for a successful Father&#8217;s Day. </span></p>
<h2><b>#1: Stop taking Father&#8217;s Day for granted</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-1.jpg" alt="Stop taking Father's Day for granted" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don&#8217;t see a lot of guides helping Amazon sellers prep their products and their store for Father&#8217;s Day sales. While not as big as Prime Day, Black Friday, or Easter, Father&#8217;s Day is yet another opportunity to move more products off the digital shelves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the stats that prove why Amazon sellers should start taking Father&#8217;s Day seriously:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, shoppers spent about $17 billion on Father&#8217;s Day</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% of Americans are shopping online for father&#8217;s day gifts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">36% of adults between the ages of 18 and 44 are planning to gift Dad experiences this year</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>#2: Market the right products</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-2.jpg" alt="Market the right products" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are selling knitting supplies or spa gift kits, you might wanna skip prepping your store for Father&#8217;s Day. The most popular categories for Father&#8217;s Day include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home and gardening</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools and appliances</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic gadgets</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sporting goods</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal care items</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automotive accessories</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clothing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grill and grilling accessories</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t have a lot of merchandise for men? Consider selling greeting cards shoppers can give to their dads. </span></p>
<h2><b>#3: Your detail page should scream Father&#8217;s Day!</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-3.png" alt="Your detail page should scream Father's Day!" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most effective ways to position your products as an ideal dad&#8217;s gift is by dressing your copy, images, A+ Content and Storefront for the occasion. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create an additional banner in your </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon A Plus Content</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">highlighting how your product can be the perfect Father&#8217;s Day gift.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create an </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-photo-editing-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon infographic image</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighting the discount running on the product.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edit your copy and add catchy phrases like &#8220;Perfect gift for the grill master&#8221; or &#8220;A high-tech present for your high-tech dad.&#8221;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the Store Versions feature, highlight the products from your brand that are on sale.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>#4: Understand that your target customers aren&#8217;t dads</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-4.jpg" alt="Understand that your target customers aren't dads " width="1339" height="506" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examine your copy and creatives to determine if they would resonate with your target audience. Your ultimate target audience is dads, but mothers and children would be your primary customer for this holiday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out their perception about their dads and be mindful of the dad images you are portraying on your detail page. </span></p>
<h2><b>#5: Promote off-Amazon</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-5.jpg" alt=" Promote off-Amazon" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Off Amazon traffic lets you make sales before any extra noise comes in. Here are some of the ways you can bring external traffic to your listing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a Father&#8217;s Day gift guide on your website. Dads are notoriously difficult to shop for. That&#8217;s why people are usually looking for inspiration when picking the perfect Father&#8217;s Day present. Providing shoppers with a gift guide that promotes products from your Amazon store is a win-win situation for both. Leverage social media and email marketing to promote the guide. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Run a Father&#8217;s Day centric contest on social media. You can ask your followers to share a funny story about their dads, an emotional moment, quirky habits their dads have, or the best thing they love about their dads. Prizes for participating or winning can include an Amazon coupon or promotion code.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Valentine&#8217;s Day and Mother&#8217;s Day, Father&#8217;s Day is easily forgotten. Your customers may need a gentle reminder to purchase gifts for their dads and grandads. Leverage your email list to let them know that Father&#8217;s Day is getting closer and show how few units are left to create urgency and encourage shoppers to make a purchase. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>#6: Bundle your dad-products</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-6.png" alt="Bundle your dad-products" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products like beer glass sets, wallets, grill and grilling accessories sell like hot cakes on Father&#8217;s Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you happen to sell in any of these categories, bundle the complimentary products to increase the total order value. For example, if you are selling grills, bundle your grilling accessories along with your bestselling grill to promote your products while also getting rid of slow-moving inventory. </span></p>
<h2><b>#7: Make sure your dad-centric products are Prime eligible</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-7.jpg" alt="Make sure your dad-centric products are Prime eligible" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh shoot! I forgot to buy a gift for dad!&#8221; This happens a lot on Father&#8217;s Day. You want to ensure that your products are eligible for Prime to target the last-minute shoppers. Additionally, gift-wrapping services can be offered to reduce the number of things on a last-minute shopper&#8217;s to-do list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are able to provide these customers the ease and convenience and ease they are looking for, you&#8217;re more likely to win their sales. </span></p>
<h2><b>#8: Market Father&#8217;s Day eligible products using PPC</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-8.jpg" alt="Market Father's Day eligible products using PPC" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you should start Father&#8217;s Day promotion four weeks prior to the holiday, you can still make your presence felt by aggressively marketing your products. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at the Father&#8217;s Day 2021 data and identify which eligible products performed well around the holiday. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launch individual campaigns utilizing high-performance Father&#8217;s Day related keywords.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote 3-4 products together using Sponsored Brand campaign. You can make the campaign more appealing by adding an appropriate headline and a custom image. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost the budget of Father&#8217;s Day PPC campaigns to let them perform at their full potential.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure your campaigns do not go out of budget on Father&#8217;s Day week.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule a meeting with one of our </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-ppc-optimization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon PPC optimization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experts to prepare a paid advertising action plan focused towards increasing your Father’s Day sales. </span></p>
<h2><b>#9: The usuals</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-9.jpg" alt="The usuals" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review your product detail pages for low-quality images, clunky descriptions, or missing information. To reduce the number of returns and refunds, you want to succinctly communicate as much information as possible. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the traffic and conversion rates on dad-centric SKUs. If they are dropping, troubleshoot the issue as soon as possible. One of the best ways to find improvements in your products is to look at the most recent customer reviews. Shoppers are quick to share the inconvenience caused to them because of your product in the customer review section. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add Father&#8217;s Day focused keywords in the backend and the copy to rank higher for terms like Father&#8217;s day gift, gift for dad, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>#10: Don&#8217;t stop even if the holiday&#8217;s over</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-10.jpg" alt=" Don't stop even if the holiday's over" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Father&#8217;s Day shopping sales hardly ever end on Father&#8217;s Day. Just like the last-minute shoppers, you might want to keep the discounts running for the late shoppers, who completely forgot Father&#8217;s Day and are buying gifts a few days after the holiday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, you should keep the discounts and promotions running on your store about a week after Father&#8217;s Day ends.</span></p>
<h2><b>#11: Be mentally prepared for an increase in returns</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Image-11.jpg" alt="Be mentally prepared for an increase in returns" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that quite a few Father&#8217;s Day gifts will be returned because the hard-to-please dads, instead of saying “Thanks kid, what a lovely gift!”, said, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; and &#8220;Why would I need this?&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you cannot do anything to prevent the returns altogether, you can at least ensure that your shoppers have a seamless return experience so they won&#8217;t mind buying from your brand again. </span></p>
<h2><b>Gear up for a successful dad&#8217;s day</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most sellers face a summer sales slump this time of the year. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you should give up. Prepping your store for Father&#8217;s Day and effectively marketing your products is the perfect way to start your summer sales with a bang. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too busy shopping for a memorable gift for your dad? Let our </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/best-amazon-consultants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best amazon consultants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manage and prep your Amazon store for the holiday while you figure out how to make the day special for your dad.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>What is Amazon Enhanced Brand Content (EBC) / </b><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/"><b>Amazon A+ Content</b></a><b>?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon A+ Content, formerly called Enhanced Brand Content, allows brand registered sellers to refurbish their existing text product description using high-quality product images, hero banners, infographics, crisp text blocks and comparison charts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beautiful headings, larger-than-life hero banners, and brand-centric sales copy – all combine to set your product and brand apart in a way that’s not possible through the text-only description.  </span></p>
<h2><b>How much does Amazon EBC Cost?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/">Amazon EBC</a> is correctly available free to all sellers enrolled in Brand Registry 2.0. </span></p>
<h2><b>Benefits of adding A+ Content to your listing</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allows sellers to describe crucial product information, features, benefits and USPs succinctly. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlights brand story and value proposition to differentiate from the competitors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Amazon, adding A+ Content to a listing can boost the conversion rate by 10%.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps shoppers make an informed purchase decision, ultimately reducing negative reviews and returns.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differentiates your brand from the competitors who lack the same standards.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduces bounce rate by giving shoppers all the information they need to make a purchase.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifestyle banners used in A+ Content helps shoppers envision the product in their lives. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Tips for creating effective <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/">A+ Content</a>?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your A+ Content should convey brand identity and establish loyalty. You can do this by dedicating a module to communicate brand ethics, story and unique value proposition.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-sell and up-sell using the comparison chart module.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 47% of Amazon customers are now using their mobile devices to shop. If your EBC is not optimized for smaller screens, you are losing half of the customers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of building walls of text, cherry-pick catchy taglines and integrate them into lifestyle banners to make it easier for the shoppers to digest information. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoppers will be eager to read the reviews. To ensure they don’t scroll past your A+ Content, grab their attention using a bright-colored, bold banner or a lifestyle image. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show your target audience in lifestyle images to better connect with your shoppers. For example, if you are selling menopause supplements, you might want to show a 50-something woman enjoying their life and staying fit.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlight all important product details using infographic banners. It makes boring information fun to look at and keeps your EBC from being overwhelming for the shoppers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave plenty of white space to create a cleaner look.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embed storytelling to build an emotional connection with the shoppers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire professional </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/ebc-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EBC service</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for best results.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With millions of businesses trying to get noticed on Amazon, having a reputable brand has become crucial for businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors. A cohesive brand-building strategy can help your products become known, loved and favored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon offers a wide array of creative tools to help sellers make their presence felt in Amazon’s over-saturated marketplace. The challenge, however, is to harness the right tool and leverage them effectively. </span></p>
<h2><b>How can creative tools help build a brand on Amazon?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1.jpg" alt="enhanced brand content" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest drawbacks of Amazon is the uniformity of the marketplace. The high-end, best-quality products will be displayed roughly in the same format as their cheap replicas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools like A+ Content, Storefront, etc., are geared towards increasing brand recall on Amazon. It’s where sellers can display their brand story, showcase brand ethics, build an emotional connection with the shoppers and stand out from the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While almost every tool designed to promote your product on Amazon is pay-to-play, these creative tools let you turn heads without spending a dime. </span></p>
<h2><b>#1: A+ Content</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2.jpg" alt="Amazon A+ Content" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon A Plus Content</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lets brand registered sellers jazz up their existing description using crisp text placements, hero banners and comparison charts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps brands answer common customer questions and showcase what makes their products truly special. Unlike text descriptions that usually get unnoticed and scrolled down, A+ Content compels shoppers to stop and take notice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of content tool caters to more discerning shoppers who want to learn as much about your product before making a purchase decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Amazon, when created correctly, A+ Content can increase your conversion rate by 10%.</span></p>
<p><b>Best practices:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoppers will be eager to read reviews, so to make sure they don’t scroll past your A+ Content, use a brightly colored hero banner or an enticing lifestyle image to capture the shopper’s attention. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing brings a brand to life than images of bright, happy people. It instantly makes your brand look more human. Be sure to use models that are relevant to your product and target audience. For example, if you are selling a supplement that helps with vertigo symptoms, your hero banner should show a person hiking/climbing on top of a mountain, looking happy, confident and satisfied. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate shoppers about similar products from your brand using the comparison chart module. Each displayed product can embed a hyperlink to promote cross-selling and up-selling. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than creating a layout jam-packed with text and images, leave plenty of white space to create a cleaner, subtle look. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cherry-pick catchy taglines and compelling stats into a banner to highlight your product USPs.</span></li>

<h2><b>#2: Stores</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3.jpg" alt="amazon a plus content" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Stores, also known as </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Brand Storefront</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a mini-me version of your website. Brands showcase their catalog and brand story using multimedia content. The motive here is to give customers an overview of everything you sell, in one place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like a website, </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon brand store design</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can include multiple pages, and each can be customized using various tiles – image tiles, video tiles, shoppable image tiles, product tiles, bestselling product tiles, recommended product tiles and more. </span></p>
<p><b>Best practices</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storefront isn’t a place to hawk your wares. Every storefront should include a dedicated page describing why you started your brand, what drives you and what sets your products apart from the competitors. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 50% of the shoppers are going to view your storefront from mobile. That’s why it’s a good idea to look at the mobile preview of your storefront. If you are forcing your shoppers to pinch and zoom, you might as well skip creating a storefront. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add multiple pages and subcategories to organize your product catalog. Well-organized stores make it easier for shoppers to find the product they’re looking for.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive off Amazon traffic to your store and use your store home page as the landing page. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze how well your store is driving sales with Store insights. Monitor KPIs like daily views, visitors, units sold, sales per visitor, etc., to optimize the performance of your store. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create dedicated pages for newly launched products, products on deals and best sellers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use interactive modules like shoppable images to tag multiple products in a single banner. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage shoppers to click on the “Follow” button on the navigation bar. </span></li>
</ol>

<h2><b>#3: Video</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4.jpg" alt="enhanced brand content amazon" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producing quality videos for your product is hard. Equipment is expensive, and hiring a specialist can cost even more. That’s why most sellers settle for photos and copy to do their magic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the video marketing statistics by Hubspot will help you understand why creating a quality video is worth the investment. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video is the #1 content type used by marketers to sell products and services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">73% more visitors who watch product videos will make a purchase.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71% of consumers prefer video over other marketing content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">87% of Gen Z prefers branded videos or ads that show someone talking about a product.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55% of consumers use videos for purchase decisions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans are visually wired to prioritize visual content before the text. By adding a product video to your listing, you are giving customers information about the product more succinctly. Videos can also increase conversion rates, reduce the number of negative reviews and returns, and help sellers address the most common customer issues and concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Videos can be used for Sponsored Brand Video ads, Amazon listings and Storefront. </span></p>
<p><b>Best practices</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make sure your video resonates with the shoppers, don’t just go on and on about the product. Your video should be about the problem, the solution and the experience. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show your target audience. If you’re selling a baby product, show new moms and babies using your product in the video.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show your product within the first few seconds of the video. If you have lengthy introductions, you might lose customer interest.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video should be no longer than 45 seconds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to include a call to action. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inject some personality and showcase your brand’s unique value proposition.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use on-screen text to better communicate product features and benefits.</span></li>

<h2><b>#4: Posts</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5.png" alt="amazon enhanced brand content design" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon introduced Posts in late 2019 as a way to give shoppers a blend of a social-media-esque buying experience. Amazon Posts are linked directly to <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/">product listings</a> and help drive the discovery of your brand for absolutely FREE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Post can include multiple ASINs (up to 10), so if your product has multiple size or color variations, you can promote them all in a single Post. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They appear on your detail page, on your competitor’s detail page, in the Related Post Section and automatically show up as a sub-page with your Store.</span></p>
<p><b>Best practices</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post frequently to capture more real estate on competitor’s detail pages and defend the real estate on your own detail page. Just like algorithms on other social media platforms, Amazon favors the brands that keep new content flowing constantly.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save the sales pitch for bullets and description. Instead of talking about how great your product is, tell people how it can make their lives easier. If your Post outlines the features and USP of your product, show them as benefits. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the Posts interesting, creative and problem-solving. Brands can show the product in use to spark interest or an infographic to educate shoppers. In the caption, they can answer an FAQ or include a happy customer testimonial to build trust. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not have the budget to create additional content for Posts, recycle your existing social media content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posts work best when it shows the product in use.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using collages or overlaid text, buttons, or icons. Your Posts should not look crowded. </span></li>

<h2><b>#5: Live</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/6.png" alt="a+ content amazon" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live allows sellers to interact directly with customers in real-time. It works similar to the QVC network or televised shopping. As the shoppers watch the broadcast, they have the ability to browse and purchase the featured product. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoppers who opt to “follow” our brand will receive notifications when you live stream. During a stream, shoppers can chat with you, ask questions, give feedback and redeem live-only promotions. </span></p>
<p><b>With Amazon Live, brands can:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Host live product demonstration videos</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate the audience about the features and benefits of the product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help shoppers make an informed buying decision</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote special offers in a creative way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answer common customer questions in real-time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interact with your paying customers and know the feedback on your product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build awareness for your brand</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Streams appear on your product detail pages as well as across various placements where Amazon shoppers browse. The livestream can also be configured to display on your Amazon Store.</span></p>
<p><b>Best practices</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livestream for at least 30 minutes. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage shoppers to interact with you. Ask them to hit the reaction buttons, follow your brand and leave questions and feedback in the comments. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include multiple call-to-action to let the shoppers know what they need to do</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of just telling about the product, show the product in action. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase your livestream’s reach by sharing it off Amazon. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote a special deal that only your audience can take advantage of. This will give shoppers value and a reason to keep coming back to your live streams. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be confident. If you don’t feel comfortable in front of a camera, you can always hire an influencer, ask your </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon marketing consultant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or get someone else from your team to do live streams.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livestream during major events like Prime Day &amp; Black Friday to promote ongoing deals on your store.</span></li>

<h2><b>#6: Brand Story</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7.png" alt="enhanced brand content" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon brand story offers a new way for sellers to tell their unique brand story, connect with the shoppers and drive sales. It is launched as an addition to A+ Content and features 5 different modules with advanced functionality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently Amazon updated the module choices in the brand story opening a wide range of capabilities. Brand story now appears as an interactive scrollable carousel with modules that showcase your product catalog and link directly to your storefront or product detail pages. </span></p>
<p><b>Best practices</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showcase your unique value proposition. When creating modules, ask yourself, “What’s so different about my brand and products?”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t just focus on your product; you have A+ Content for that. Include information about your business as a whole. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlight the brand’s most popular products using the “Brand ASIN and Store Showcase” module. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to include the logo and related brand pictures to help shoppers connect with your brand.  </span></li>

<h2><b>#7: Manage Your Customer Engagement</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/8.jpg" alt=" amazon enhanced brand content designer" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in early 2021, Manage Your Customer Engagement, or MYCE as we call it, allows brands to initiate email campaigns to shoppers who choose to “follow” your brand. Shoppers can follow your brand through various paths, but it is often done through Amazon storefronts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tool can be used to promote a new product launch, highlight a group of products, and send holiday-themed emails. You’re pretty restricted as to what copy you can add because Amazon has created predefined templates for each email type. </span></p>
<p><b>Best practices</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have an active storefront and encourage shoppers to follow your brand </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although you cannot alter the copy in Amazon’s premade campaigns, you have the option to add an image to make the email look visually appealing. You can add a unique lifestyle or show product in use to entice shoppers to know more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send emails at regular intervals to keep shoppers updated. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes about 72 hours for Amazon to review your image assets, be sure to plan accordingly.</span></li>

<h2><b>Are you ready to up your creative game on Amazon?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is continually going to roll out new creative tools to help the brand thrive in the marketplace. It’s up to you to leverage these opportunities and include them in your marketing strategy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have not yet registered your brand on Amazon, do it immediately. Every creative tool featured in this article requires brand registry. You can either attempt to register your brand yourself or ask your </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon consultant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do it for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot that goes on to turn your creative imagination into reality. A thrown-together A+ Content or a bland storefront can set shoppers off, which is the last thing you want. If you don’t have a talented in-house team with Amazon experience, we’d recommend hiring an </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-content-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon content agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who can create enticing content tailored for your brand and products. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When tentpole events like Prime Day and Turkey 5 are near, you often hear sellers talking about running Lightning Deals. Hundreds of Lightning Deals are featured on Amazon daily and the number’s even higher on big sale days, but the question is, are Lightning Deals right for your brand?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog post, we’re going to share all insights and recommendations related to running Lightning Deals on Amazon.</span></p>
<h2><b>What are Lightning Deals?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Deals are time-bound, hot flash promotions that run for usually 4 to 12 hours (as determined by Amazon).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-4.png" alt="What are Lightning Deals?" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are available, one per customer, until either the promotion period expires or all the available inventory is claimed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Amazon hosted 45,000+ Lightning Deals in a non-Prime Day month and the number has continuously increased since then.</span></p>
<h2><b>Are Lightning Deals the same as Deal of the Day?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers often mistakenly use the terms Lightning Deals and Deal of the Day interchangeably. While both the deals offer products at a sale price and create a sense of urgency, Deal of the Day features different products every 24 hours. Lightning Deals run for a few hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deal of the Day or Today’s Deals retains the deal price till the stipulated end-time (generally midnight) or till stocks last. When a customer adds a product with a Lightning Deal to their cart, they only have 15 minutes to process the order, or they miss out on the deal.</span></p>
<h2><b>Where do Lightning Deals appear? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Deals are prominently displayed on the Amazon Deals page, the most popular and highly trafficked parts of the website and on SERPs.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-3.png" alt="Where do Lightning Deals appear?" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When live, Lightning Deals show your product image, product title, promotional discount amount and final price, a status bar showing the percentage of deals already claimed and a timer showing how long you have to add the item to your Cart and claim the promotional discount.</span></p>
<h2><b>Eligibility criteria for Lightning Deals</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Deals were originally invite-only. Amazon would handpick sellers to run Lightning Deals on its website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently all sellers and vendors that meet the eligibility criteria can run Lightning Deals for eligible products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for deals, you must be a professional seller with at least five seller Feedback Ratings per month and an overall rating of at least 3.5-stars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Deals can be created on almost any product, as long as they are new, FBA or Seller Fulfilled Prime. Additionally, products must meet these criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a sales history in Amazon stores and at least a 3-star rating.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include as many variations as possible.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not be a restricted product or offensive, embarrassing or inappropriate product.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be Prime eligible in all regions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be in a new condition.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Amazon, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible products will be automatically displayed in the “Eligible ASINs” section of the Deals Dashboard. Eligible ASINs are refreshed every week, so an eligible ASIN you see this week may not necessarily be there next week.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For big sale days like Prime Day &amp; Black Friday, you’ll have to submit your request for creating Lightning Deals at least four weeks in advance.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is the cost for running Lightning Deals?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have to pay a hefty amount to run Lightning Deals. The cost ranges between $150 to $600 per ASIN. The fees keep changing based on timing, marketplace trends and expected traffic, but the exact amount will be displayed while you are creating Lightning Deals and adding details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be charged for every Lightning Deal that has successfully run on Amazon’s website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also look at the fees after Lightning Deals completes its run. Go to Reports &gt; Payments &gt; Transaction View &gt; Service Fees.</span></p>
<p><b>Important:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your product fails to remain eligible while the deal is running, it can be removed from the Deals page and you will lose all your money.</span></p>
<h2><b>Three types of Lightning Deals</b></h2>
<p><b>#1: Prime Early Access Deals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, products enrolled in Prime Early Access Deals are available only to the Prime members as an early access to purchase the product before non-Prime members. The deal features a “Learn More” call-to-action button that shows Prime members information about the product.    </span></p>
<p><b>#2: Sponsored Deals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime members or not, everyone can see these deals. These deals are called “sponsored” deals because the seller has paid extra to get a lucrative position during the sales event. Just above the call-to-action button, you can see the seller’s brand name and star ratings.</span></p>
<p><b>#3: Price Range Deals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of a definitive discounted price, shoppers will see a price range that covers the prices of all the variations of the product.</span></p>
<h2><b>How to create Lightning Deals on Amazon?</b></h2>
<p><b>Step 1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open your Seller Central account and hover over to the “Advertising” tab. From the dropdown menu, click on “Deals”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-3.png" alt="How to create Lightning Deals on Amazon?" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on “Create a new deal.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4-3.png" alt="Click on “Create a new deal" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select a product in your inventory.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-3.png" alt="Select a product in your inventory." width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter the Schedule. The applicable fees will be shown here. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-2.png" alt="Enter the Schedule. The applicable fees will be shown here." width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><b>Step 5: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Deal price or Discount per unit, and Minimum deal quantity. Click Continue to the next step.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/7-1.png" alt="Deal price or Discount per unit" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><b>Step 6: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have set your deal parameters, click Submit to submit your deal for review.</span></p>
<h2><b>What if I don’t like the time slot allotted to me for Lighting Deals?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no way to influence the exact day and time your Lightning Deals will be live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are lucky, your Lightning Deal may appear on a weekend morning when shoppers are busy shopping. Your deals can also appear at 2 am on a weekday when there is hardly any traffic on the website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Amazon accepts your Lightning Deal, they will provide the exact day and time your deal will run. If you don’t like the time slot, you have the option to cancel the deal, provided you cancel it 24 hours before the deal is live.</span></p>
<h2><b>Pros and cons of Lightning Deals</b></h2>
<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Creates a sense of urgency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, encouraging the shoppers to buy right away.</span><b> </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Drives discoverability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your brand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers often use Lightning Deals to </span><b>supercharge sales velocity and visibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during events like Prime Day &amp; Black Friday.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps </span><b>move overstock</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or end-of-season inventory.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps boost specific product visibility.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incites a long-term lift in </span><b>organic ranking and sales.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest drawbacks of Lightning Deals is that you cannot choose the exact time at which the deals will go live. Amazon can run the deal whenever they want during the selected date range. If they decide to show your deals after midnight, from 1 am to 5 am, your products won’t be getting optimal exposure because of the low traffic on the website.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every seller can afford to pay such hefty fees to get their product featured on Amazon’s deals page.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon requires you to offer a discount of at least 15% off your regular price to qualify, hurting your overall profitability.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Lightning Deals best practices</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8-1.jpg" alt="Lightning Deals best practices" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><b>#1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that your product listing is in top-notch shape. To make sure your detail page is ready for the traffic, make sure you have:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/9-1.jpg" alt="To make sure your detail page is ready for the traffic, make sure you have" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A keyword rich and informative title, five bullet points with crucial product information and a description that beautifully tells your brand story</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9 high-quality images, including a hero image, infographics and </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-photo-editing-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lifestyle product photography images</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A+ Content</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A video</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure how to start with Amazon listing optimization? Our </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/ecommerce-seo-consultant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eCommerce SEO consultant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s can help!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2: Make sure you are fully stocked up for the day Lightning Deals will be live and for the expected halo effect after the deal ends. Inventory for Lightning Deals must reach FBA centers a week prior to the sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#3: Prolong the Halo effect by aggressively promoting LD ASINs with</span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-ppc-optimization/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon PPC optimization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4: Run Lightning Deals for products that are already ranking well and are successful – in short, your bestsellers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#5: Promote ASINs that have Lightning Deals with </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Sponsored ads.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">#6: You may want to consider the seasonal popularity of your product. For example, products like bathing suits are more likely to sell more during summers. Look at your product’s sales history to determine its seasonal popularity.</span></p>
<h2><b>How to check the performance of your Lightning Deals?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can check how effective your Lightning Deals were by going to the </span><a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/merchandising-new#search-and-filters" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage Deals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page and analyzing important metrics like units sold, deal revenue (SKU specific), and total deal revenue (for all SKUs).</span></p>
<h2><b>Are Lightning Deals right for my brand?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Deals don’t make sense for every brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it is completely possible to have a successful Prime Day or Black Friday without including Lightning Deals in your marketing strategy, these money-making, hot flash sales have become a new way for sellers to capture shoppers’ attention.</span></p>
<p><b>According to Jungle Scout, </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A product sees a 65% boost in sales on the day Lightning Deals are running</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day after the sale, your product will still see a 39% increase in sales, thanks to the halo effect</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the third and fourth days, the boost in sales drops to 22% and 19%, respectively</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the sixth day, your product will see less than a 10% the boost in sales</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the total boost in average daily sales is expected to be 200%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the above data is for a product that is already successful and profitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To calculate if Lightning Deals are right for your brand or not, determine your gross profit per unit after applying the Lightning Deals discount. Based on that, determine the number of units you will have to sell in order to recover the Lightning Deals fees. Next, look at your daily sales and find out if it’s possible to break even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might also want to consider the long-term benefits of Lightning Deals like halo sales for several days to come, an increase in organic ranking, product’s strengthened visibility and a boost in BSR ratings, all of which can lead to a permanent increase in overall sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Lightning Deals are not cost-prohibitive for you, you should definitely give it a try. Get in touch with our </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;" title="Amazon Consultants">Amazon consultants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and find out how they can help you create successful Lightning Deals for Prime Day and Black Friday 2022.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success on Amazon begins with choosing the right products. If you are looking to launch new products on Amazon, the niche data given by Amazon&#8217;s Product Opportunity Explorer tool will make it easier for you to discover &#8220;unmet customer demand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep reading to learn more about this new tool and how to use it to research new product opportunities.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Product Opportunity Explorer?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2021, Amazon launched the Product Opportunity Explorer tool, an ingenious product research tool that delivers useful insights into customer behavior and helps sellers gain a better understanding of shopper demand using real-world search data.</span></p>
<p><b>Straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth: </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunity Explorer allows you to understand Amazon customer search and purchasing behavior to evaluate if there is unmet customer demand and an opportunity for you to meet that demand through new products. You can explore up-to-date and accurate data on customer needs and the current selection on Amazon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging Amazon&#8217;s accurate data, sellers can take the guesswork out of identifying high-potential products. The tool gives detailed information on what shoppers are searching for, what terms they are using for searching for a product, what they are clicking on, what they are buying and what they are not buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers will get all the details they need to evaluate new product opportunities, expand their catalog and </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-marketing-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boost Amazon sales</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The metrics they will get access to are search term volume, sales history in a given category and pricing trends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other metrics they can explore are how quickly gross merchandise sales in the niche have grown over time, whether a shopper&#8217;s interest in the niche is long-term or short-term, average star rating for products and the searches converted to sales.</span></p>
<h2><b>Who can use this tool?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new tool is available to all 3rd party sellers selling in US and DE, but it will be rolled out to other Amazon marketplaces throughout 2022.</span></p>
<h2><b>Is there a fee?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, this tool is available to all sellers at no charge.</span></p>
<h2><b>Where can I find the Product Opportunity Explorer tool?</b></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll find the Product Opportunity Explorer tool in the &#8220;Growth&#8221; drop-down menu on your Seller Central dashboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OR</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to this link: </span><a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/opportunity-explorer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sellercentral.amazon.com/opportunity-explorer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&#8217;t have access to this tool, ask Seller Central support to know when you can get it or contact your </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-marketing-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon marketing agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>How does it work?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Product Opportunity Explorer works by evaluating &#8220;niches,&#8221; – which are essentially a collection of top related customer search terms and top related clicked/purchased items. The niche will be named after the top-ranked customer search term. Search terms and products can meet more than one customer&#8217;s needs and can be in multiple niches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s what the Product Opportunity Dashboard looks like.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-2.png" alt="amazon product listing optimization" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon shows a variety of &#8220;niches&#8221; based on the current category you are selling in. In addition to suggested niches, sellers can enter a search term in the search bar or &#8220;find opportunities by categories.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the data you will be looking at won&#8217;t be for a particular category or a particular keyword, but it will be for a group of products and a group of keywords. By leveraging past data, Amazon provides data on the sales history associated with that niche over the past 90 or 360 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll also see the following data.</span></p>
<p><strong>Search Results page: The resulting page after searching, browsing, or filtering for niches; the results page shows summary metrics for each of the returned niches.</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-2.png" alt="amazon listing optimization services" width="1339" height="506" /><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source: Amazon</span></i></p>
<p><b>Niche Details, Products Tab: This tab provides ASIN-level details on the products within the niche.</b></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4-2.png" alt="amazon product listing optimization" width="1339" height="506" /><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image source: Amazon</span></i></p>

<h2><b>How can the Product Opportunity Explorer tool help sellers?</b></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-1.jpg" alt="amazon optimization services" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers who have no idea on what their next product would be can browse subcategories for inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers can also run a search for a key term and identify how many shoppers are actually looking up for phrases relevant to that term. For example, if you&#8217;re on the fence for launching &#8220;woodland theme baby shower supplies,&#8221; you can look up the popularity of the term as well as the search volume in the past 90 and 360 days along with search volume growth percentage, average price and number of clicked products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers who aren&#8217;t looking to expand their current product portfolio can use this tool to determine a competitive price for their products. A question every Amazon seller ponders upon is, &#8220;What&#8217;s the right price for my product.&#8221; Pricing not only affects your CTR rates and conversion rates but is also a deciding factor when it comes to winning the coveted Buy Box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By looking at the Product Opportunity Explorer tool, sellers can actually get an insight into what the market is trading at.</span></p>
<h2><b>Is it actually better than Helium10 &amp; Jungle Scout?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Product Opportunity Explorer is a new tool launched by Amazon, it is not new for sellers. Amazon&#8217;s in-house product research tool is similar to third-party seller tools like Jungle Scout &amp; Helium10. The biggest difference, however, is that while most third-party tools have to estimate the data, Amazon&#8217;s Product Opportunity Explorer tool is sharing </span><b>real search data</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, sellers get access to exclusive data not available on other tools. For instance, the Product Insights table shows you the number of sellers using Sponsored Ads. Analyzing this data can help sellers determine how easy or difficult it is to buy their way to the top of SERPs through </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-ppc-optimization/">Amazon PPC optimization.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But sellers who are accustomed to using sophisticated and user-friendly tools like Jungle Scout and Helium10 might find Amazon&#8217;s Product Opportunity Explorer tool a bit too tedious. We feel that the Product Opportunity Explorer should be easier to use and understand for the new sellers in the arena.  </span></p>
<h2><b>Find your next product opportunity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers looking to add new products to their catalog can take advantage of Amazon&#8217;s inside data to discover new product opportunities. Until now, sellers could only guess what their customers were searching for, but with this new tool, this crucial data is now easily accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just be sure you are doing your own research and taking advice from the </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/best-amazon-consultants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best Amazon consultants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because the last thing you want is to tie your funding up in a product that sits in the FBA centers costing you money.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video marketing is at its prime. It&#8217;s personal, it&#8217;s dynamic, it&#8217;s informal and hands down, the most effective form of advertising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engagement, response and sales brands get through video marketing are astronomical, yet brands are hesitant to give it a try. Many brands don&#8217;t want to go beyond the traditional forms of advertising, while others find making a video a hassle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers who are on the lookout for new ways to amplify their brand message and make their presence felt in the highly saturated Amazon marketplace must include Amazon Live in their marketing strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out what Amazon Live is and is it right for your brand? In this blog post, we&#8217;ll answer some of the most common questions about Amazon Live.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Amazon Live?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live is an interactive streaming platform that gives shoppers a new way to shop and sellers a new way to market their products. It allows brands to inform, educate and inspire customers helping them better understand your products.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-Amazon-SEO-services-1.png" alt="amazon seo services" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live is similar to livestreaming on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, or TikTok, except that the audience watching Amazon livestreams is there with purchase intent, so the chances of them converting to customers are very high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands can use their pre-recorded (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not recommended</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or live video content of their products and shoppers can interact with the video in real-time by leaving a comment, sharing the video, or using the &#8220;star reaction button.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2><b>With Amazon Live, you can:</b></h2>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Host live product demonstration videos</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Educate the audience about the features and benefits of the product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help shoppers make an informed buying decision</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote special offers in a creative way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answer common customer questions in real-time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interact with your paying customers and know the feedback on your product</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build awareness for your brand</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As customers watch the live videos, they can browse and purchase the featured product, thanks to the ever-visible &#8220;buy it now&#8221; button</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4-Amazon-product-listing-optimization-experts-1.png" alt="amazon product listing optimization" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand owners can either host themselves, use in-house talent, or partner with an influencer to broadcast live on Amazon.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers who &#8220;follow&#8221; your brand will also receive notifications when you go live, so they never miss a stream.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5a-Amazon-PPC-consultant-1.png" alt="amazon ppc consultant" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Amazon has denied giving any numbers on how many brands are using Amazon Live, they did say that on Prime Day 2020, around </span><b>1200 live streams were running on the page.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos can be saved for viewing later, beyond the &#8220;live&#8221; period.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands also have the option to boost their livestream. As stated by Amazon, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Livestream boosting allows you to pay to help expand the reach of your livestream on Amazon, driving discoverability of your content to a broader audience across the site. To leverage paid boosting, you choose a budget for the livestream and a CPM bid.&#8221; </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon livestreams appeals to the shoppers in the consideration phase of their buying journey as it encourages them to know more about your products and helps you out-edge your competitors.</span></p>

<h2><b>The history of Amazon Live</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon&#8217;s first attempt to launch a live streaming platform was in 2016 when they launched &#8220;Style Code Live,&#8221; a streaming platform where Amazon employees used to host each segment of products. If you don&#8217;t recall Style Code Live, it&#8217;s probably because the feature was canned in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Amazon created the Live Creator app, which lets shoppers view live videos from their phones. In July 2020, Amazon Live was open to influencers that were enrolled in Amazon&#8217;s Influencer&#8217;s program.</span></p>
<h2><b>Who is eligible to use Amazon Live?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live is available to all sellers enrolled in the brand registry program, </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-marketing-agency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon marketing agency</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Amazon Influencers with an active influencer storefront.</span></p>
<p><b>Important:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live is only currently available in the US.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vendors (using Vendor Central) are not allowed to use Amazon Live.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live streaming from China is not allowed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Amazon Live Creator app is currently only available and optimized for the iPhone.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Where can shoppers watch live streams?</b></h2>
<p><b>Shoppers will be able to view your live streams on:</b></p>

<h2><b>Three levels of Amazon Live</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadcasting brands can unlock new benefits as they reach new levels in Amazon live.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/10-Amazon-marketing-agency-1.png" alt="amazon marketing agency" width="1339" height="506" /></p>
<p><b>Level 1: Rising Star </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Rising Star, brands can livestream as often and whenever you want using the Amazon Live Creator app.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this level, your streams are eligible to automatically appear in the product category rows on the Amazon Live homepage, as well as in the &#8216;Live Now&#8217; row at the top of the page.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a shopper clicks on your live stream, it will play at the top of the page video player.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Level 2: Insider </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this level, you continue to get all the benefits of the Rising Star level, but your streams become eligible to automatically play in the top of page placement on the Amazon Live homepage when shoppers visit the page.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands must stream for at least 90 minutes in 30 days to reach this level.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Level 3: A-List</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands continue to get all Rising Star and Insider benefits.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach this level, brands must stream for 1000 minutes in 30 days, drive $5000 sales, or sell 100 units in 30 days.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands get special access to Amazon Live events and priority support from the Amazon Live Creator team.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your livestreams are eligible to automatically appear on all Rising Star and Insider placements and the Amazon.com home page.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>A few reasons to give Amazon Live a try</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live streaming is one of the most easily overlooked marketing strategies. Most brands are either skeptical about doing live streams or are completely unaware of Amazon Live. If you have the time, resources and an enthusiastic face to host and create meaningful content for your potential shoppers, Amazon Live is definitely worth it. Here&#8217;s why:</span></p>
<p><b>#1: It&#8217;s a new way to get noticed&#8217;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live is not &#8220;just another way&#8221; to market your product. If you get a desirable time slot, the chances are that you will be able to showcase your product in front of hundreds and thousands of potential shoppers. Just like PPC and Amazon SEO, Amazon Live can help you reach untapped audiences </span><b><i>effectively</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because we are wired to prioritize visual content before text.</span></p>
<p><b>#2: Capture shopper&#8217;s attention on tent pole events</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoppers often use Amazon Live to find out about new products and ongoing deals using Amazon Live. Start using Amazon Live a few days before big seller days like Prime Day &amp; Black Friday to let customers know about the deals running on your store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Amazon, a beauty brand featured on Amazon Live &#8220;saw a 103% sales lift during the hours they were featured on Amazon Live compared to their average unit sales per hour over Prime Day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the live stream, you can promote deals exclusively for the viewers. This will drive urgency since the deals will run only for a limited period of time. By awarding discounts, you&#8217;re also providing value to shoppers who join, encouraging them to watch your live videos more often.</span></p>
<p><b>#3: It makes your brand looks more human</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text and static images simply can&#8217;t beat the multi-sensory engagement that a video provides. Amazon Live especially appeals to shoppers who like to learn about the ingredients or want to see a dress worn on someone else prior to purchasing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone demonstrating the product and seeing the product in action fills the void of not being able to touch or experience the product before making a purchase decision.</span></p>
<p><b>#4: You can directly interact with the shoppers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Amazon disabled comments on reviews, Amazon Live is probably the only way to directly interact with the shoppers. You can ask them feedback about your product, let them ask you questions, or sell the features and benefits in a convincing way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your live stream will also appear on your product detail page, giving confused visitors more information to make a confident purchase decision.</span></p>
<p><b>#5: It&#8217;s more effective than social media lives</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoppers browsing on Amazon are already there with purchase intent, so your videos and livestreams are more likely to be converted into sales.</span></p>
<p><b>#6: It&#8217;s free</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live is completely free to use and technical barriers to entry are low, so brands with a limited budget and technical knowledge can jump in and run awesome broadcasts in front of hundreds of shoppers.</span></p>
<h2><b>How to measure the success of your live stream?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;ll find performance metrics from within the app. Although the sales lift because of livestream is not disclosed by Amazon, you can still get to know the organic reach of your broadcast and a breakdown of paid boosting (if any).</span></p>
<h2><b>The only con</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring success can be challenging. Brands do not have access to the percentage of sales uplift because of Amazon Live. We can never know how many shoppers who visited your live video actually decided to go to your product detail page and make a purchase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the challenge in measuring success, Amazon Live is worth investing your time and efforts in. It&#8217;s a prime space to tap into a broader customer base, educate about your product and increase reach.</span></p>
<h2><b>Amazon Live best practices</b></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Live stream for at least 45 minutes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create promotions and coupon codes exclusively for live viewers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to promote repeat viewership.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Encourage your viewers to follow your brand.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The follow button works similar to the subscribe button on YouTube, making it easy for customers to stay updated about ongoing discounts and new product launches.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Don&#8217;t just go on and on about your product. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Show live demonstration of how your product can solve shopper&#8217;s problems.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not confident enough to host, </span><b>ask someone else to do it for you.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If budget allows, </span><b>partner with an influencer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">because shoppers are more likely to interact with a face they are familiar with.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Your videos do not need to be overproduced to be engaging</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All you need is a little bit of confidence and a lot of enthusiasm. The only goal of livestream is to get shoppers excited about your product and tell your product features in a compelling way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Livestream during major events like Prime Day &amp; Black Friday</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to capitalize on the increased traffic on the detail page.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Don&#8217;t stop just because your first few live streams</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>didn&#8217;t yield any results</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stay consistent.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoppers, just like our furry friends, need constant attention; make sure to </span><b>keep them engaged via Q&amp;A, callouts, and more. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Make announcements on social media channels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and your website to get the word out.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hire </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon listing optimization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experts to make sure your detail page is ready for the traffic. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2><b>To set up Amazon Live, brands can either:</b></h2>
<p><b>1) Create videos themselves</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because a brand owner or someone from the in-house team understands the nuances of the product really well, the videos produced will be more effective and appealing. And it&#8217;s affordable too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only downside is if you aren&#8217;t very comfortable in front of the camera, you may not be able to effectively sell the product, despite knowing all the features and benefits.</span></p>
<p><b>2) Partner with an influencer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencers create content day in and out, so the videos created by them look professional, more engaging and creative. By partnering with established influencers, you can leverage their loyal audience of followers who may be looking for a product like yours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only con is that the cost of hiring influencers can quickly eat up the profits you earned from livestreams.</span></p>
<p><b>3) Let Amazon promote your products on Amazon Live</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands can integrate into &#8220;carefully curated, often themed and always inspirational with a purpose&#8221; Amazon-produced live shows. Amazon hosts provide authentic testimonials and demonstrations to educate shoppers on products available on the Amazon store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon-produced livestreams typically require a minimum spend of $50,000 (US).</span></p>
<h2><b>How to get started?</b></h2>
<p><b>Step 1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download the Amazon Live Creator app.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Select a date and time. Brands can choose to live stream whenever they want. Amazon recommends live streaming </span><b>later into the day and evening and on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Decide upon the products that will be featured in the livestream. You even have the ability to load promo details and price in your product carousel.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Develop a script for broadcast. Make sure it aligns with Amazon community guidelines. Before the broadcast, rehearse the script and check for any potential technical problems.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> During the broadcast, ensure that you have a team member with you to answer customer questions and troubleshoot the issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&#8217;re live, Amazon will put your video in from every shopper who might be interested in your product.</span></p>
<h2><b>What not to do in the live stream?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably you already know the answer. Don&#8217;t attempt to steal Amazon customers and lure them to your website, social media channels, or anywhere outside Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don&#8217;t know if there is a sophisticated system in place to police thousands of videos every day, but we are sure the thought of Amazon customers being stolen away by smart sellers must have occurred to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s always better to be safe than to be suspended.</span></p>
<h2><b>Lights, camera, ACTION!!</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Live is a highly lucrative marketing tool that drives discovery and valuable traffic to your detail page for absolutely FREE. There&#8217;s no reason not to give it a try. A little exposure never hurt anyone.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of more than 2.5 million sellers selling on Amazon, only 10% generate more than $100,000 annual sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it’s because their products and customer service are great, but it’s also because they have made the right decision of hiring experts instead of doing everything on their own.</span></p>
<h2><b>You need an account manager if you answer even one of these questions in “yes”:<br />
</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you struggling to boost sales on Amazon?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you find difficulty in understanding and following Amazon’s long list of stringent rules and guidelines?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you find yourselves too overwhelmed to manage your Amazon account?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you think your products have more potential?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you like to increase your product’s reach and drive more revenue?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is not rocket science. But that does not necessarily mean that you have the experience and, more importantly, time to manage all aspects related to your Amazon business. Here’s what you’ll need if you want to manage your Amazon business yourself:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Years of experience:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amazon account management and consulting is not a start-and-stop endeavor. The most seasoned Amazon experts will tell you that they’ve been working on hundreds of Amazon accounts consistently over the course of many years. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tools: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a successful Amazon business takes more than skills and knowledge. You’ll need a whole slew of tools – tools to do product research, tools to do competitor analysis, tools to do keyword research, tools to ask for reviews, tools to manage inventory. Have you considered the cost of each of these tools?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Proactiveness: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever stumbled upon the seller news page? There is a new update almost every day. Did you know Amazon is going to increase FBA fees by starting April 24th?Your Amazon account manager might know because that’s what they do day in and day out. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Here are a few logical reasons why you should hire an account manager instead of attempting to DIY</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes time and lots of trial and error to understand and master the moving parts of the Amazon account. It’s a learning curve and you probably already have a lot on your plate. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot match the experience and expertise of a professional Amazon account manager in a span of a few months. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be pulled away from other important aspects of your business.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desired results may take longer. When you hire an agency, there will be more people constantly working on getting you results. Account managers can help you out with new account setup, suspended accounts, inventory disasters, inventory forecasting, pulled product listings, IP infringements, advertising failures, case management and so much more. </span></li>
</ul>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon A+ Content, previously called Amazon Enhanced Brand Content, allows brand registered sellers to transform the product description of their branded ASIN.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using various EBC modules, brands can describe the product features, USP, benefits, uses and specifications in a visually appealing way.</span></p>
<h2><b>Benefits of adding EBC to your listing</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps boost the conversion rate by 3-10% (according to Amazon)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visually rich content appeals to shoppers better than a plain block of text</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When created the right way, EBC gives shoppers all the information they need to make a purchase</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gives a branded and professional look to your listing</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Answering common EBC questions:</b></h2>
<p><b>1) Is EBC indexed by Amazon?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon has confirmed that A+ Content is not indexed by Amazon, but it is indexed by search engines like Google, so it will still help increase visibility.</span></p>
<p><b>2) Is there a fee for creating A+ Content?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A+ Content is available free to all sellers registered in the brand registry program. This also includes sellers selling through Amazon Launchpad and the Amazon Exclusives Program.</span></p>
<p><b>3) What’s the difference between Amazon EBC, A+ Content, A++ Content, and Premium A+?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers often get confused between these terms. Let’s sort this out today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When EBC was first launched in 2017, it had predefined templates where third-party sellers could add images and content. A+ Content at that time was for vendors (first-party sellers) only. A+ Content had exclusive modules that were quite similar to A+ Content modules you’re seeing presently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/amazon-merges-ebc-a-content-into-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon combined EBC and A+ into one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so now sellers and vendors have the same modules to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A++ Content and A+ Premium Content are the same. A++ Content is an invite-only feature and is way better than EBC (and expensive, too!). Brands can add more interactive modules, videos, expandable FAQs and more. Learn more about Premium A+ Content </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/amazon-premium-a-content-everything-you-need-to-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>4) What type of modules can I add to my EBC and how many can I add per EBC?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands can add up to seven modules per EBC. Below is a list of EBC modules:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logo</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon image text modules</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparison chart modules (works great for cross-selling)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banner modules</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product specification modules</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carousel module</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modules with bulleted feature lists</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard text-only modules</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>6) How long does it take for Amazon to approve EBC?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon approves or rejects the EBC within seven days. If your EBC is rejected, Amazon will state the exact reason for EBC rejection. Read our blog to know the </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/reasons-for-amazon-ebc-storefront-rejection-the-most-comprehensive-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">common reasons for EBC rejection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>7) What will happen to my current description once EBC is live?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The A+ Content will override your current plain-text description. Ensure that your A+ Content contains all the information from your product description field. Although your text description won’t show on the detail page, it will still be indexed from the backend.</span></p>
<p><b>8) Is it worth adding EBC to my listing?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, yes, a hundred times yes! EBC instantly elevates the look of your listing. Beautiful headings, high-quality lifestyle banners, and engaging copy all combine to make your brand stand out. It decreases bounce rate, increases engagement and reinforces brand equity. Look at the example below; what would you rather want to look at if you were on the detail page?</span></p>
<h2><b>Without EBC:</b></h2>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We get asked this a lot: “Is Amazon PPC right for me?”, “Will I be able to make more revenue than what I spend?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon PPC is the fastest way to get your product on top of the SERPs. According to Ad Badger, Amazon PPC ads make up about 30% of Amazon sellers’ total sales. Yet many sellers are skeptical about using PPC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your PPC campaigns are created effectively, you’ll see an instant boost in visibility and sales, with more products flying off the shelves. </span></p>
<h2><b>Benefits of PPC</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>PPC ads are cost-effective:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With PPC, you can have complete control over your spend since you pay only when customers click on your ads. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>PPC ads give you instant success:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Although organic optimization is important, it sometimes takes months to get on the first page. With PPC, you can shoot yourself to the top of SERPs within hours of listing your product. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>PPC can improve your organic ranking:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you bid strategically on a particular keyword, you can also see an increase in organic ranking for that keyword. So, in a nutshell, PPC is important.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, it’s also important to remember that it isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it thing. You’ll need to constantly monitor and optimize your ads to ensure you’re reaching your target KPIs. Everyday optimization is crucial for PPC success because it’ll provide you with valuable insights and help you to make sure your campaign runs profitably. Here are a few metrics you should track within your Amazon PPC campaigns:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost per clicks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click-through rate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impressions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ad spend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACOS</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Conversion rate</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before bringing any traffic to your product detail page or campaign landing page, just make sure your detail page is ready. Ready in the sense that when the customer visits your product page, make sure they don’t get disappointed because of lack of crucial information or out-of-stock label.</span></p>
<h2><b>Here are the factors to consider for determining the retail readiness score of your product:</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Images &#8211; all 9 images consisting of lifestyle and infographics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviews &#8211; at least 15+ verified reviews with a star rating of 3.5 or above</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So to revisit our question, is Amazon PPC worth it? The answer is yes – only if you know how to make it work for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPC management and optimization is a hefty undertaking which is why you must hire a professional Amazon PPC agency that can put in the work for you and ensure your campaigns run hot 24/7.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get started with creating EBC, you’ll need:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand registry</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An agency that can help you create EBC</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Amazon advertises A+ content as a self-service option, you must not attempt to create it on your own unless you have a thorough knowledge of Amazon guidelines and an in-house design team that has experience in creating A+ Content for Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want your EBC to look visually appealing and that can be achieved only when a professional works on it. Amazon calls it “branded content” you cannot get it over with by adding 1-2 modules, a few white background images and text sections. To make sure your EBC leaves a lasting impression on your shoppers, hire a professional. And no, any designer won’t be able to make EBCs. Amazon has a long list of rules on what you can and cannot add in Amazon EBC. Always, always hire a professional agency that knows all the ins and outs of creating EBC. </span></p>
<h2><b>Let’s learn how to upload EBC to seller central</b></h2>
<p><b>Step 1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To add A+ Content to your listing, open your seller central account and hover over the “Advertising” tab and click on “A+ Content Manager”.</span> &nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-2.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click on “Start creating A+ content”</span> &nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1300" height="572" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-1.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">From here, you will have two options: Enhanced product description (basic) and brand story (appears under From the brand). Click on Enhanced Product Description. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1300" height="572" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-1.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To know more about the brand story, </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/new-modules-introduced-to-the-amazon-brand-story-feature/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add content name and select language. Language should be based on the language of the marketplace you are selling in and the language of your A+ Content. Not adding correct language can get your EBC rejected.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1300" height="572" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4-1.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 5: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start adding modules. Add modules as per your layout. Although Amazon EBC appears as one big image, it is actually a combination of several small images. Please ask your EBC designer to give you all the assets in advance before you upload the EBC.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1300" height="572" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-1.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 6: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Populate the modules with images and content. You’ll need to add meta keywords while uploading every image. Image keywords/meta keywords are a simple phrase describing your image. This can include the brand name of the product, features of the product, or synonym keywords of the product. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" width="1300" height="572" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-1.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 7: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once finished, scroll to the top and click on the “Apply ASIN” button. </span> &nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Amazon.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 8: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the “Add ASINs” section, you can find and apply the ASIN for which you have created the EBC. You can also bulk upload ASINs by uploading an excel sheet. </span> &nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" width="1300" height="572" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/71.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your ASIN is ineligible, it’s because the ASIN is not enrolled in your brand yet. Contact seller support for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 9</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: After you’re done adding ASINs, click on the Review and submit button.</span> &nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" width="1300" height="572" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/81.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 10:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here, you will be shown a preview of the EBC and all the ASINs you’ve applied. Check everything properly. Don’t forget to check the mobile preview to ensure mobile shoppers can have an equally great experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re ready to upload, click the “Submit for Approval.”</span> &nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" width="1300" height="572" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79565" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/91.png" alt="" /> &nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon can take up to 7 days to approve or reject your EBC.</span> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
