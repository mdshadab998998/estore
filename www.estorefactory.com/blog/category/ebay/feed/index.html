Even the sellers have their independent <a title="ebay Management" href="https://www.estorefactory.com.au/ebay-management/">eBay product listing services</a> that they can avail from the premier service providers like eStore Factory.</p>
<p>The scenario is going to change because nearly 3.9% of the sellers make millions on this selling platform after Amazon. Moreover, the online marketplace has come with its own version of eBay Buy Box that is known as ‘Our Pick’. Its own Buy Box now comes with the Group Similar Listings that has changed the full scenario.</p>
<p><strong><u>Considerable Points on Group Similar Listings</u></strong><br />
The eBay marketplace has nearly 1 billion of duplicate listings that have affected the selling of the eBay listed sellers.

The Group Similar Listings will help the sellers and buyers in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sellers who are given top reviews by the customers will be shown under the Buy Box Group Similar Listings on the top. Firstly, on eBay, for an example, if 500 sellers are selling the same product, then 500 items list will be shown. Now with the help of Group Similar Listing, only the best sellers list will be displayed to the buyers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ranking of the seller’s products can top the Grouped Listings if the <strong><a title="Product listing SEO" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/professional-seo-services-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Product listing SEO</a></strong> is done carefully. If the seller is selling the best product at the lowest price, it will be shown under the ‘Buy Box’ or ‘Our Pick’ by eBay.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The sellers can feature in the Group Similar Listings with the help of the competitive price, great product description and photos, and unmatched customer service.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With the grouping of the items required by the customers now, the search experience has improved, and buyers can filter for buying the best product. This will help the buyers to see the product page with various listings in order to get the particular product at the foremost price.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The sellers must make this program as their default setting so that they can understand its algorithm that will help them to be shown in the searches. Moreover, this will also help them to make good sales if the buyer is using Group Similar Listings or Buy Box option.</li>

<p>The relative updates in the eBay store design and listing templates were set to take effect from May this year. According to the survey, there are more than 1 billion products present on eBay and nearly 81% of the newer items out all these products are being sold until now. However, to see the worth of investing in the listing templates and store designs, it is mandatory to take the advice from the professional eBay listing consultant.

<p><strong>Cons</strong><br />

<p>• The listing template involves the HTML markup but with the introduction of ‘Group Similar Listings Function’ now, the buyers cannot see the product descriptions on their mobile or PC devices. This has made the sellers rethink whether they should invest in listing templates or not.</p>
<p>• With the demotion of the HTML templates related listings by the Search Engine Cassini, the sellers are made to rethink over their decision to get the listing templates or not and whether to ditch their store designs too.</p>

The eBay has put forth many reasons to remove the active content policy from their platform as it affects the following.</p>
<p>• Nearly 58% of people who visit the E-Commerce platform come from the mobile devices. This has a huge impact on the users as most of the times active content restricts the mobile purchasing activities.</p>
<p>• Moreover, the active content takes more time to load the web page. According to a survey, 40% of people will abandon using the eBay if it takes more than 3 seconds to load a web page.</p>
<p>• This will cause a huge loss to the sellers as the mobile users will find all this frustrating, and they will never visit the website again. The removal of active content will speed up the loading time and will increase traffic too. This will improve eBay <a title="SEO services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/professional-seo-services-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEO services</a> as rendered by professionals like eStore Factory.</p>
<p>• Active Content causes many concerns about the security issues that includes the introduction of the malware. For controlling this issue, the eBay has decided to remove the third-party plug-ins.</p>
<p><strong><u>Major Effect on the eBay Sellers</u></strong><br />
As Google has issued guidelines for making the E-Commerce platforms mobile-friendly, the removal of active content is seen in a good light. eBay has nearly 168 million active users, so the elimination has become important for the <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com.au/ebay-management/">eBay listing optimization</a>. However, the major effects on the sellers are as below.</p>
<p>• This will distort the product listing and lead to losing a buyer.<br />

• People will not be able to read the texts correctly.<br />
• Buyers will not understand the seller’s product listings and what does it exactly sell.<br />
• Poor performance on the Mobile devices<br />
• The removal of plug-ins will leave a negative space in one’s product listing.<br />
• Slow loading of the templates the eBay store<br />
• Poor impact on the traffic of the store, the sales and the revenue generation</p>
<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong><br />
The banning of the Active Content has come as a huge task for the eBay sellers who have thousands of listing. The removal of the content is possible only for sellers with few listings.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the digital era; most of the key business dealings take place on the internet in present days. Since online trading has become a buzzword these days, therefore, maximum competitions are quite common now. Eventually, only the best online retail-trading firm or e-commerce portal can survive while others will simply fail. As per an estimate, now 75% of the sale and purchase takes place online.</p>
<p><strong><em>According to the 2016 study on consumer behavior, around 90% of the customers felt that they would respond to an e-commerce deal</em></strong> only if it offers “new, improved and unique” products or services to them. They tend to ignore the rest of other firms offering routine products or services.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are unaware that simple things matter a lot in the world of e-commerce. Whenever a consumer or user logs onto an e-commerce portal, it becomes necessary for the company to fulfill customer’s expectations with an overall satisfying internet surfing experience.</p>
<p><strong><u>Visual Experience:</u></strong> An entrepreneur should always implement his <a title="e-commerce SEO services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/professional-seo-services-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e-commerce SEO services</a> effectively to grab the attention of the customers. By visual experience, we mean better pictures, fonts, and the web designing part that creates visual impact in the mind of the customers for a long time.</p>
<p><strong><u>Add to Basket:</u></strong> This is a quite common option that is available on almost all e-commerce portals these days. When a customer simply chooses a product, it should automatically go to the cart to create a positive impact on the minds of the customers. These days, customers are hi-tech. They prefer deals that take the least possible time to complete.</p>
<p><strong><u>Check Out Process:</u></strong> Every customer wants a hassle-free online transaction process. The e-commerce product optimization helps the user select the most demanding products at one go and immediately move to “check out” section to make payment.</p>
<p>The latest market research survey has stated that around <strong><em>77% of the customers seriously dislike any sort of online transaction that takes more than 7 minutes to complete.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Product Description:</u></strong> According to eStore Factory, a leading online marketing firm offering <a title="Amazon Consulting Services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Consulting Services</a>, “the product description page holds a key to the success of the firm”. Therefore, the product description page should not only have the relevant product details in brief, but it should also have attractive pictures and some other necessary content for consumer’s help.</p>
<p><strong><u>Product Recommendations:</u></strong> Alongside making the entire surfing process more attractive, an entrepreneur should trick the website design and widgets as well in such a fashion that customers keep receiving other relevant product recommendations constantly appearing on the site as a slider or widgets, as long as he stays on the site.</p>
<p>The 2017 survey on consumer behavior has claimed that around <em><strong>23% of the e-commerce portal users always try other products too if it comes with attractive offers and discounts</strong></em>.</p>
<p>In the current times of a rampant hunt for consumers, it requires utmost professionalism and expertise to grab customer’s interest in a particular brand for a long time. For eBay sellers, eBay listing optimization is the ultimate key to augment their sales and business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ultimate success of a business firm is its global appeal. Hence, every firm wants to execute its marketing strategies in such a way that the brand becomes worldwide in due course of time. These days, e-commerce selling has become quite popular among the online traders.</p>
<p>Among online retail giants, Amazon and eBay are the most famous ones for overseas marketing. Simply by tweaking <strong><a title="Amazon SEO services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon SEO services</a> </strong>or taking the help from experts like eStore Factory, a seller can enhance his online visibility and generate better income too.</p>
<p><strong><u>International Selling Tips for Amazon Retailers</u></strong><br />
1) A seller should make fulfillment of Amazon program (FBA). Under it, the seller stores all products to an Amazon warehouse where the company handles shipping and packing. Then it becomes easier for the dealer to sell across Europe.<br />
2) A single every pervasive Amazon seller account is necessary to reach out to thousands of new European customers.<br />
3) Seller has to make regular payment of storage and fulfillment charges for his ‘items for sale’.<br />
4) The Amazon marketing services ensure timely delivery and astute after-sale-service to end users.</p>
<p><strong><u>Overseas Marketing Tips for eBay retailers</u></strong><br />
1) The users can view any product advertised for sale on eBay across the globe.<br />
2) EBay operates in 42 countries. So, simply by eBay listing optimization, a dealer can grab the massive attention of the international customers.<br />
3) EBay is fully safe for online transactions with advanced encryption and algorithms.<br />
4) EBay’s Global Shipping Program (GSP) is spearheading the company’s entire international business.<br />
5) This program allows dealers to sell a product normally while the shipping and custom charges are borne by the customers.<br />
Cross-Border Trade through eBay</p>
<p>EBay offers cross-border trade by allowing customers to purchase products of their choice from any place. In case, an <strong>eBay seller</strong> does not want to ship his products to a particular nation whatsoever then eBay allows blocking those users. Before arriving at a product’s final price, the seller needs to add shipping cost to the existing eBay&#8217;s products list.</p>
<p>In some other cases, the portal lets dealers increase eBay sales by directly listing their products through nation-by-nation basis. For example; if a seller wants to sell his products on eBay.fr, then it allows the seller to set prices in Euros. Sellers should facilitate web page translation so that French consumers can understand the same better.<br />
Cross-Border Trade through Amazon</p>
<p>Amazon also facilitates overseas marketing. A seller simply needs to include his products on the country-specific Amazon sites. He will also have to pay the <strong>FBA</strong> fees while customers will bear the shipping charges.</p>
<p>Another option that Amazon offers is allowing the seller to send more products to Fulfillment centers, as the seller pays only the required fees in the domestic denomination.</p>
<p>Through the optimum use of the <strong>Amazon products listing</strong>, an online retailer can easily ensure the appearance of his products on the front page of the site for greater visibility and enhance sales. Moreover, you can hire the professionals of eStore Factory, an <a title="ecommerce service provider" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ecommerce service provider</a>, to increase their business with overseas sales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The study on <em><strong>Google paid search came out with very interesting statistics. Q4 grows around 19% every year in comparison to last year</strong></em>. It will be highly beneficial for a business enterprise to make the best out of it and optimize its future AdWords campaigns accordingly.</p>
<p>An online entrepreneur has to work harder and ensure close monitoring of all changes to augment his sales. Amazon consultant like eStore Factory usually runs a top sellers campaign to identify any modification in clicks, conversions, and cost for ad groups. Such reports can be both positive and negative but always helpful for the online retailer to formulate his future business plans.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Here are Some Other Key Strategies</strong></span><br />
<strong><u>Ad Performance Report:</u></strong> One of the best ways to get the real sense of your <strong>online business</strong> is by analyzing your account status through running an Ad Performance Report in AdWords. It also helps you know Click Through Rate (CTR) and Average Cost Per Click. The status column shows all the necessary details by appropriate <strong><a title="Amazon product optimization" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon product optimization</a></strong> technique. CTR is highly effective to measure the actual efficiency of the ad campaigns that you recently ran.</p>
<p><strong><u>Search Query Report:</u></strong> It is useful to generate the true searches that grab maximum attention in an ad. <strong>Online e-commerce</strong> trader should analyze the data carefully to examine its real performance and modify the same if needed.</p>
<p><strong><u>Auction Insight Analysis:</u></strong> An <a title="eCommerce solution provider" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eCommerce solution provider</a> should also look into the insight report and compare the same with his online campaigns. If it gets better ranking, then people are definitely intrigued by the charm of this online ad campaign.</p>
<p><strong><u>Total Campaign Efficacy Report:</u></strong> Some entrepreneurs also want to analyze the total efficacy of their campaigns online. Then they need to analyze the campaign performance report in totality. Once the report is prepared it gives the complete analysis of the site’s AdWords performance, respective valid and invalid clicks, impressions, bounce rate and several other things.</p>
<p><strong>An online retailer can analyze his total campaign efficiency report in just a few steps.</strong></p>
<p>Login to AdWords Account and see the campaign tab.</p>
<p><strong><u>Now, several options will appear:</u></strong><br />
<strong>a) Clicks:</strong> It reflects the total clicks on the ad campaign.<br />
<strong>b) Impressions:</strong> It reflects the true figure that how many people reached via that online ad.<br />
<strong>c) CPC:</strong> It calculates the total cost that ecommerce providers have to bear as cost-per-thousand impressions during the campaign period.<br />
<strong>d) Positions:</strong> It reflects the ranking of the ad in comparison to others.</p>
<p><strong><u>Keyword Usage Analysis:</u></strong> In the world of online business, keywords matter a lot. It could be a make or break opportunity for any Amazon service provider or those associated with any other e-commerce giant. It is highly useful for a trader to know which keywords perform well and which does not, especially at the Q4 season.</p>
<p><strong><u>Advertisement Extension Report:</u></strong> The primary aim of this online analysis is to gauge the real success of a firm’s ad extensions. The extension includes a number of things such as phone number, website URL or “contact us” forum that ensures maximum sales in Q4.</p>
<p>Analyzing AdWords, Google and Amazon report is important to get desired success at <strong>Q4 on e-commerce platforms</strong>. It acts as a revelation because the online seller gets to learn so many things by some simple online calculations.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once temperature soars high, and all schools are shut due to summer vacations, the online sales also witness a significant drop. No wonder,<strong> e-commerce dealers</strong> find it extremely boring, and loss-making time of the year. However,simply by optimizing <strong><a title="Amazon marketing services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-marketing-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon marketing services</a></strong> online, a firm may still earn a lot during the off-season.</p>
<p>An Amazon seller has to tweak his business strategies during the summer season to ensure more sales and profits. Considering lower online traffic in summer, the best way to attract more buyers is by putting useful and relevant content on the site along with customers’ reviews that prompt users to buy products online instantly.</p>
<p><strong><u>More Satisfied Customer’s Reviews:</u></strong> During the off season, an entrepreneur has to work harder. <em><strong>A recent survey has stated that around 90% of the customers believe in online reviews and recommendations of the other purchasers.</strong></em> So, when your products have more positive reviews on eBay and Amazon, it enhances your sales too. You should always request your customers to leave their feedbacks online after every purchase.</p>
<p><strong><u>Improve Your Amazon &amp; eBay SEO:</u></strong> That’s when you need to hire an Amazon &amp; eBay SEO consultant like <strong>eStore Factory</strong>. They are the experts and have ample experience in ensuring that you get the greatest traffic on your Amazon or eBay product page.</p>
<p>The product keywords should be optimized in such a way that maximum customers get attracted to your product. You get 500 characters to optimize the page – make the best out of it including as many relevant keywords as possible.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cheap and Best:</u></strong> Nothing works best than this simple strategy. While, many sellers try to win the buy box to get more sales, keeping the price rate comparatively cheaper could do the trick during the off-season when not too many sellers are active on online portals.</p>
<p><strong><u>Discount and Offers:</u></strong> Continuity in sales is important during the summer season. So, it will be apt for an online seller to offer an attractive discount on his products at off-season. Usually, such items grab maximum eyeballs in the eBay products listing as customers usually want to buy products that offer highest discounts to them.</p>
<p><em><strong>A seller can also release unique coupon codes in the site with discount offers ranging from 10% to 80% or more. Such coupons are used to retain customer’s loyalty.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><u>Diversify Your Products:</u></strong> Those who sell seasonal products suffer maximum during the summer season. An online e-commerce dealer should try to diversify his product range. Ideally, he should deal with a wider product range for sales on <strong>eBay and Amazon</strong>. Also, a seller should check his emails regularly to resolve customer’s enquiries properly as they could be his prospective clients.</p>
<p>So, a drop in sales is not a big issue unless it continues longer. During the summer or off-seasons, sales figure may drop, but sellers do not need to be panicky. By improving <strong>Amazon &amp; eBay services</strong> and offering better products to customers, an online retailer could still get to manage to sell his products more.</p>
