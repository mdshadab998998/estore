<p><span style="color: #0e101a;"><i><b>Amazon has received about 800,000 negative reviews in April and 945,000 negative reviews in May, which was twice the amount received in 2019.</b></i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Amazon’s superfast shipping is the gold standard in the online selling industry. But because of continuous shipment delays, customers were frustrated. Sadly the world’s most customer-centric company failed to “delight” its customers. Not so surprisingly, negative reviews started to increase dramatically in March. In the USA, Amazon received about 800 thousand negative reviews in April, which was double the amount of negative reviews received last April. Not just the USA, negative reviews have increased in almost every Amazon marketplace. Japan, for instance, where negative reviews are rare, saw an increase from 2% to 10%. According to a survey conducted by MarketPulse:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">The number of negative reviews in May 2020 increased to 945,000 from 345,000 in May 2019</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">Amazon received about 1 million negative reviews in the last 30 day period which is double the usual amount</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">13% of the customers had a negative buying experience on Amazon which is 5% higher than the usual</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;">49% of the reviews mentioned the words such as late deliveries never, received, package and tracking</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Seeing the stats above, it’s apparent that COVID-19 hasn’t just taken a toll on everyone’s sales, profits and lifestyle but also on the hard-earned reviews and ratings. Sellers should know the measures to avoid any negative reviews in the future and prepare for managing negative reviews. Read on to know more.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Quick guide to deal with negative reviews (coronavirus edition):</b></span></span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14366" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-2.jpg" alt="Quick guide to deal with negative reviews" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-2.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-size: large;">#1: Be honest with your customers:</span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14358" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1.jpg" alt="Be honest with your customers:" width="800" height="347" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1-600x260.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1-300x130.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1-768x333.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Communication is the key. Nothing pisses off a customer more than a lack of communication. Imagine you ordered a product four-five days back, you haven’t heard from the sellers since then. How would you react? Is my product shipped? When is it going to arrive? Have I been cheated? Did they run away with my money? Now, in this case, only if the seller had informed you that the shipment might take up to 7-8 days, wouldn’t you be calmer. Being a responsible seller, you should stay proactive and inform your customers in advance about the shipping delays. Even better, make updates in your listing stating that the product may not be delivered in the promised two-day window. Most buyers will understand the situation and won’t mind waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Be sure to communicate with the buyer via Amazon Buyer-Seller Messaging. This can positively affect your impression. A little communication can go a long way to improve the experience of your customers. There is nothing wrong in explaining the situation to your customer; even Amazon expects you to do that, take a look at the message below. Amazon sent this to one of the sellers.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14359" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-2.png" alt="Shipment Delay" width="1098" height="309" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-2.png 1098w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-2-600x169.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-2-300x84.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-2-1024x288.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-2-768x216.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1098px) 100vw, 1098px" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-size: large;">#2: Stay alert and be prompt</span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14360" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1.jpg" alt="Stay alert and be prompt" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">The first tip was about being proactive as to what you should do to avoid negative reviews. This tip is about what you should do if you have got a negative review. Well, first, you should take immediate action. Customers don’t like waiting and they expect an answer from you sooner than soon. 53% of the shoppers expect you to reply within a week. Amazon obviously doesn’t send any alerts or notification for negative reviews or seller feedback. So it’s up to you to keep a watch on your listings and reply as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-size: large;">#3: Keep an eye on your negative seller feedback, or it can lead to account suspension</span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14361" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1.jpg" alt="negative seller feedback" width="900" height="368" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1.jpg 900w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1-600x245.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1-768x314.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Seller feedbacks are just as essential as a review, actually even more. Negative feedback, Credit Card Chargeback Rate and A-z Guarantee Claims are all a part of your Order Defect Ratio (ODR). It is essential that you maintain your ODR below 1% or your account can get suspended. Amazon had relaxed its policies for account suspensions for shipment related performance metrics, but now after two months, it has again started tracking accounts that do not fit its set criteria. Amazon removes seller feedbacks that have abusive language or any identifiable information about the seller. Amazon can also remove feedback if it’s actually a product review. If you find any such feedback, go ahead and report that feedback to Amazon.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-size: large;">#4: Try and remove the negative review</span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14362" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1.jpg" alt="Try and remove the negative review" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">If you have a negative review that’s badly affecting your sales, you have two options to get rid of it: (a) get Amazon to remove the review or (b) do something to correct the situation. Amazon will remove under the following circumstances. First, if you are using FBA and the review is about receiving a damaged product, late shipment, or anything related to Fulfilment. Second, if the reviewer has used abusive language or not followed Amazon review guidelines. If you find any such negative reviews, you can immediately report to Amazon and the review will be removed. Now, if the negative review does not fall under any of the above-mentioned circumstances, you can reply to the customer directly in the comments section. Everyone is very well aware of the current situation and your customers will totally understand why you weren’t able to ship the product on time. Either reply back to them in the comments or draft a professional email explaining the situation. If possible, offer them a refund or discount on the next purchase. This will highly increase the probability of a customer removing the negative review. If you decide to reply to respond to the customer directly, make sure you do it the right way.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-size: large;">#5: Respond Professionally:</span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14363" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1.png" alt="Respond Professionally" width="1233" height="790" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1.png 1233w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-600x384.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-300x192.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-1024x656.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-768x492.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1233px) 100vw, 1233px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">No matter how nasty the review is, you should not lose your cool and respond politely. First, thank your customers who took out time to share some information about your product. Never ever copy-paste the message. Boilerplate responses never work because it shows your lack of interest. You should also address each customer with their name and talk with them like you mean it. You are replying to resolve their issue, so it is essential that you give your contact information in the message. This is something customers really appreciate.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">Every cloud has a silver lining and every negative review has a positive side:</span></span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14379" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="305" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-600x229.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-300x114.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-768x293.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><b>Opportunity to show your concern for the customers:</b></span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> Negative reviews are an excellent opportunity for you to show how much you care for your customers. About 90% of the customers read reviews before they buy and when they see you respond to a negative review like a responsible brand, their trust will increase and it will leave a positive impression.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><b>Identify your faults: </b></span><span style="color: #0e101a;">Customer posts a negative review for a reason. He must have found something wrong with your product. Although most of the negative reviews you are receiving right now are because of shipping delays, there are many other reasons to look out for. Maybe the product received was damaged, maybe the product did not work as expected under certain conditions, or maybe there’s something wrong with the description. It’s an opportunity for you to improve your product. <span style="font-weight: 400;">While our </span><strong><a title="Amazon Product Listing" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/">Amazon Product Listing</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experts optimize any product on Amazon, we read the reviews and customer questions and answers without fail. There’s so much hidden there.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #0e101a;"><b>Makes your positive reviews look realistic: </b></span><span style="color: #0e101a;">Imagine seeing a product with 1000 reviews and all positive. These are fake, of course, that’s what you would think, won’t you? Having </span><span style="color: #0e101a;"><i>a few</i></span><span style="color: #0e101a;"> negative reviews can make all your reviews look more realistic.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0e101a;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">The good news is that we are recovering:</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0e101a;">Yes, Amazon is healing and it has now recovered from essentials-only. So, the severe shipment delays will now be reduced. As a result, the spike in the negative reviews will gradually decrease. However, it would be safer to use FBM as your Fulfilment channel for a few months until everything normalizes completely. For the negative reviews you have received until now, try to remove them by contacting the reviewer. Also, remember that you aren’t alone who is going through all this; every seller selling on Amazon is in the same situation as you are. This includes the name brands like Bath &amp; Body and Apple. If keeping a watch and dealing with reviews looks too overwhelming to you, you can always count on us. Hire our <strong><a title="Amazon consultants" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon consultants</a></strong> and let them deal with the nitty-gritty of your Amazon store while you can focus on other essential aspects of your business.</span><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14379" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="305" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-600x229.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-300x114.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1-768x293.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>June has just started and we are back with yet another monthly update blog. Amidst the corona chaos, it’s okay to miss out on the announcements and changes Amazon has been making daily in its operation, advertisements campaigns and the Seller Central backend. Our team at eStore Factory has made a comprehensive list of need-to-know updates going on within Amazon that concerns you as a seller. Read on and stay updated:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1) Amazon Account suspensions are continued after two months</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13966" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1.jpg" alt="Amazon Account suspensions" width="900" height="368" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1.jpg 900w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-600x245.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-1-768x314.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of March, Amazon has loosened its seller suspension policy for some time, owing to the supply chain issues and delayed shipments. Now, after almost two months, on June 1, Amazon announced that it would start re-tracking and suspending the accounts that have high order defect rate, late shipment rate and high cancellation rate. Before a few days, Amazon had recovered from essentials-only and started accepting shipments for all the items. As a result, it has restarted tracking the seller accounts who are not taking good care of their customers. Make sure you stay below Amazon’s established performance standards because if your defect rate, late shipment rate and cancellation rate go above the ideal rate mentioned below, your account can get suspended immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Order Defect Rate: 1%</li>
<li>Late Shipment Rate: 4%</li>
<li>Cancellation Rate: 2.5%</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2) A+ Content enables copying drafts to other marketplaces</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13967" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.jpg" alt="A+ Content enables" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Amazon has combined A+ Content from Vendor Central and Enhanced Brand Content from Seller Central in 2019, it has been making constant changes to improve the backend of the now-called A+ Content Manager dashboard. Recently it allowed bulk upload of ASINs where sellers can add up to 50000 ASINs using a flat-file. And now Amazon has launched a new feature where the eligible sellers can copy drafts of the newly approved A+ Contents to other marketplaces where they do business. Previously sellers had to upload A+ Contents for each marketplace individually. But now, Amazon automatically identifies the stores worldwide and copies the draft into your account in those countries, so you don’t have to waste time in repeating the process every time. If you want to localize the content, simply translate the content and submit it for approval in that marketplace. If you want to cross copy the A+ Content for an existing ASIN, resubmit it again to automatically trigger the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3) New Payments dashboard provides sellers an at-a-glance view of their finances</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13968" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1.png" alt="New Payments dashboard" width="1017" height="1092" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1.png 1017w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-600x644.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-279x300.png 279w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-954x1024.png 954w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1-768x825.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your financial experience and payments with Amazon is now simplified with the latest update in the new payment dashboard in seller central! Recently Amazon has updated its Payments dashboard and it now provides key information from all your account types. You can easily check your current Total and Available balances, account statement and the breakdown information in an easy-to-understand graphical format. You can filter the data by account type (Standard Orders &amp; Invoice Orders) and settlement period. Any past transactions can be found simply by adding the order number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>4) Sponsored Brand Ads will be displayed on the product detail page as well</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13969" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4.jpg" alt="Sponsored Brand Ads" width="1450" height="884" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4.jpg 1450w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-600x366.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1024x624.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-768x468.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1450px) 100vw, 1450px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up until now, Sponsored Brand Ads were displayed on top of the search result page, alongside the search results or within search results. In the newest update, Sponsored Brand Ads are can now be displayed on the product detail pages, which support products and custom image creatives. Before this update, only Amazon Sponsored Product Ads and <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/product-sponsored-display-ads-amazon/">Sponsored Display Ads</a> used to reflect on the product detail page, but now Sponsored Brand Ads will also be displayed. This means that organic product suggestions would now be demoted. Seems like Amazon is running after paid promotions and forgetting that customer come to its site mainly because of the customer-centric approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5) Advertisers can create Sponsored Brands videos without sound</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13970" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.png" alt="Advertisers can create Sponsored Brands" width="988" height="377" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.png 988w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-600x229.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-300x114.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-768x293.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like Amazon has been making a lot of changes in Sponsored Brand Ads lately. Last year, it introduced <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/amazon-sponsored-brand-videos/">videos in Sponsored Brand Ads</a>. This update was a game changed for sellers as no ad format in Seller Central allowed using videos and now, when customers see a video running in between search results, they are immediately attracted. Using videos in Sponsored Brand Ads are known to drive more traffic than any other ads. Coming back to our recent update, sellers can now create videos without sound. Sellers can communicate their brand story and product efficiency through visuals. Amazon recommended placing easy to read, on-screen text to ensure that the message is communicated clearly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>6) Translations available for Sponsored Brand Ads</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13961" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.png" alt="Sponsored Brand Ads" width="898" height="916" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.png 898w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-600x612.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-294x300.png 294w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-768x783.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet another update about Sponsored Brand Ads. Amazon has released a Sponsored Brand translation feature that allows sellers to create and manage multi-lingual content on Amazon. Your customers can now engage in their local language and get a seamless shopping experience. This update has been rolled out by Amazon to provide their customers ease of shopping. On Amazon sites, shoppers can select the default language while shopping. Amazon wants that the ads featured on the non-English sites are also localized. Localized content done by <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-content-translation-service/">Amazon</a><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-content-translation-service/"> Listing Translation</a> experts appeals to the shoppers more than anything else, so if you are looking to go global, it is essential that you localize your ad content and creatives along with the listing content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>7) Amazon DSP updates</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13962" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.png" alt="Amazon DSP updates" width="1149" height="214" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.png 1149w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-600x112.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-300x56.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-1024x191.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-768x143.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1149px) 100vw, 1149px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon DSP dashboard has seen quite a few changes in recent times. First, advertisers can delete line items that haven’t delivered any impressions. This gives advertisers more control over what line items and orders are in view. Second, Amazon DSP will now filter your line items and orders with the “ended” status. This will make it easy for the advertisers to have more control over what line items and orders are in view. Third, advertisers can now edit max supply bids with a single action. This allows advertisers to manage and fine-tune bulk campaigns efficiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>8) New Amazon Custom listing features</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Amazon Custom listing experience now has many other new features where you can more easily offer customizable and make-on-demand products in your store. With these features, sellers can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charge additional fees on a selected customization options</li>
<li>Customize up to five surfaces on one product. In each surface, you can add 10 text and image customizations</li>
<li>You can add up to 20 customized fonts or select from 100 preloaded fonts</li>
<li>You can add different colors to each text fields</li>
<li>You can control the types of character customer enters including emojis, numbers, letters and capital letters</li>
<li>You can specify the number of text lines customers can add within a customization field</li>
<li>Customers can upload more than one image files in any location in the product</li>
<li>Sellers can preview the customer experience before the listing goes live</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>9) Fees Calculator introduced in Multi Channel Fulfillment</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13963" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.png" alt="New Amazon Custom listing features" width="1074" height="471" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.png 1074w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-600x263.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-300x132.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-1024x449.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-768x337.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1074px) 100vw, 1074px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon has introduced a fee calculator for simplifying multi channel fulfillment fee experience. With multi channel fulfillment, sellers can fulfill orders from non-Amazon sales channel from Amazon fulfillment centers. The new update allows sellers to quickly preview per-unit Multi-Channel Fulfillment fees. To download the calculator, go to the Multi Channel Fulfillment page and click on the Fee Calculator tab. You can add up to 250 products per file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Tip Of The Day: You Listing Can Get Blocked Because Of FDA Approved Claims</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13964" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-1.jpg" alt="Blocked Because Of FDA Approved Claims" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-1.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has this happened with you too? If you are selling a supplement, food item, or medical device, you probably would be making FDA approved claims in your listing. Turns out that if you do this, Amazon may remove your listing from the catalog without any warning. Adding FDA approved word in your listing seems like a very normal thing to you, but once your product gets blocked or removed, it can turn your world upside down. What about the inventory that has been sitting in the FBA centers? What if that product was your best selling product? Even if it gets removed for a few days, it can result in the loss of hundreds of dollars of sales. This is why it is necessary to get your listing optimized from <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/"><strong>Amazon Listing Optimization experts</strong></a> who actually know Amazon inside out, or it can cost you a lot. Make sure no FDA regarding claims are present in your content, images, or A+ Page and if they are, give a proper proof to Amazon before they block our listing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world has turned upside down. The massive shifts in the supply channels and the paradigm shift in customer behavior have left brands thinking as to what their next move should be. One of their biggest concerns is what they should do with their advertising campaigns not only for the coming few weeks but for the remainder of 2020. Sadly, there is no blanket strategy for this, but that doesn’t mean you should completely ignore your advertising efforts. It won’t be right to abandon Amazon Advertising, but at the same time, brands should rethink their strategies. Campaigns you crafted before the COVID-19 pandemic won’t be any more appropriate anymore. It’s time to take a close look at the situation and devise a new action plan. I have put together 10 useful tips that can help manage your advertising efforts in these tumultuous times. But first, it is essential that you stay updated on what’s new.</span>
<h2>Catching Up On The Coronavirus Updates:</h2>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12754" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2.jpg" alt="what’s new" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />
<h3>1) Amazon Is Affected Too:</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12755" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1.jpg" alt="Amazon Is Affected Too" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Coronavirus pandemic hasn’t just affected the sellers but the retail giant as well. Longer delivery times and restricted shipments had taken a toll on customer retention rates. In the worst weeks of April, Amazon received 800,000 negative reviews, which were double the amount in the last April. Because of the poor shopping experience, many of the customers switched to Walmart and Target for fulfilling their demands. But one thing remains true for sure – Amazon is an integral part of every shopper’s lives. Maybe the times are challenging and customers are wavering, but Amazon is a GIANT. So the sellers selling on Amazon are in a better position than others.</span>
<h3>2) Prime Day Submission Window Is Extended</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12756" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2.jpg" alt="Prime Day" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I had previously said that Amazon Prime Day had been delayed. The latest updates state that the deadline for accepting Prime Day Deals has been extended from 8th May to 5th June. This is a big relief to the sellers as they will now have more time to predict inventory and plan for the event.</span>
<h3>3) Deals Have Disappeared:</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12757" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4.png" alt="Deals Have Disappeared" width="1348" height="787" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4.png 1348w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-600x350.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-300x175.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-1024x598.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon has also suspended all the deals until any further notice. So, the deals that are already approved will run, but no new deals can be made and will be accepted. Sellers had planned many deals for upcoming holidays like Mother’s Day, but all the deals were rejected by Amazon. Amazon had also once removed Today’s Deal page and changed the look of its Homepage to feature Kindle eBooks and other Prime Video shows.</span>
<h2>10 Tips To Help You Manage Your Advertising Campaigns In The Times Of Coronavirus</h2>
<h3>#1: Stop Fretting, Start Acting</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12758" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-2.jpg" alt="Stop Fretting, Start Acting" width="675" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-2.jpg 675w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first and most important piece of advice in these unpredictable times would be: Don’t freak out. It’s not just you; everyone is seeing an uptick in ACOS and spend. Always remember </span><b>the base rule of PPC campaigns: longevity matters.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes, if your campaigns are costing you more than you can afford, go ahead and pause them. But if you are in a better situation, optimize your campaigns and not just once a week or month</span><b>. Micromanagement is a must</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>Change bid and budgets daily and add keywords from your search term report regularly. If your ACOS is spiking, don’t fret but pause any keywords that are not performing well. Review your campaigns at the product level;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if a particular ad or product has low conversion rates, high spend, or high ACOS, pause those ads until things calm down. Maintain a list of ads/keywords you have paused and rethink about them later.</span>
<h3>#2: Determine Your Demand</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12759" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1.jpg" alt="Determine Your Demand" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you hardly surviving, or are you thriving? The answer to this question will majorly help you determine your advertising strategy. Because of the pandemic, Amazon sellers are basically divided into two categories. First, the fortunate ones. This includes the sellers who have seen no surge or dip in their sales and the sellers who have seen a surge in sales because of the changing customer behavior. Second, the ones who are getting hammered. These are the ones who are worst affected by the pandemic. This includes the sellers selling beauty products (no one’s going out, right?) or luxury items. All your advertising strategies should be centered around your demand. If your business is thriving, go ahead as you normally would while also adapting to the new buying pattern. If you are struggling, go easy and focus your marketing efforts on the products in your catalog that fall under the thrive niche.</span>
<h3>#3: Stay In Stock:</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12760" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1.jpg" alt="Stay In Stock" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reshuffling of fulfillment patterns has brought about unprecedented challenges for Amazon sellers selling through FBA. The initial weeks of March proved to be quite rough as Amazon imposed a ban on shipment and fulfillment of non-essential items and prioritized the shipment of six essential categories. This created two new worries for sellers: First, they were worried about the FBA fees they will have to pay because now the inventory will be just sitting in the warehouses and second, they were concerned about the lost sales. After all, even if the customer was willing to order, they were not able to ship the product. Although now, Amazon has recovered from “essentials only” there are still limits as to how much inventory sellers can ship into the warehouses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so surprisingly, there is a chunk of sellers who were highly benefited from this situation. For instance, the sellers selling essential items like groceries, toilet paper, or sanitizers. However, it turns out that those sellers were unprepared for the unexpected spike in sales because of which they faced inventory stockouts, despite the surge in demand. </span><b>No matter in which situation you are, at this point in time, until everything is back to normal, it would be best to find a reliable fulfillment option and Amazon is definitely not on the list. For a few months, convert your products to FBM and try to handle the fulfillment yourself.</b>
<h3>#4: Monitor Your Advertising Efforts As Per Your Inventory Levels</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12746" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.jpg" alt="Monitor Your Advertising Efforts" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scale your bids depending on your inventory levels and the capacity to restock in the future.</b> If you are going to go out of stock or are already not in stock, immediately pause your advertising efforts because you don’t want to take your customers to the out-of-stock product pages; this can dramatically decrease conversions. On the other hand, <b>you should be increasing your ad spend and budget while making sure you have sufficient inventory and a reliable fulfillment channel</b>. Your Sponsored Product, Display Ads and Sponsored Brand Ad campaigns will automatically pause and resume once you have stock.</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: If you want to utilize this time to build brand awareness and don’t think it’s right to pause <strong><a title="Amazon Sponsored Ads" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon Sponsored Ads</a></strong>, link your Sponsored Brand Ad campaigns to your storefront. This way, you can make sure your campaigns will run regardless of the inventory levels.</span></em>
<h3>#5: Fine Tune Your Content Strategy</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12747" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9.jpg" alt="Fine Tune Your Content Strategy" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a survey conducted by eMarketer, 77% of respondents said they wanted advertising to “talk about how the brand is helpful in the new everyday life,” 75% said it should “inform about the brand’s efforts to face the situation,” and 86% of US ad viewers were open to brands mentioning COVID-19 in their ads.</span></i> The mention of the current situation, how your product can help them cope with the situation or what the brand has contributed will appeal to the shoppers more than anything else. <strong>Try to incorporate such sentences or keywords in your content. Just make sure that it’s all as per Amazon’s requirements. The key here is to stay relevant, original, creative and mindful of Amazon’s rules.</strong>
<h3>#6: Now Is The Time To Build Brand Awareness</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12748" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.jpg" alt="Time To Build Brand Awareness" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the customer may be shopping less for now, but they are still there, browsing on the site, randomly adding items into the cart to buy in the future. </span><b>Invest in brand-awareness campaigns and leverage the browsing traffic to reach new customers and to keep your products in the top-of-mind of the customers.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Analyze the new-to-brand metrics use this data for retargeting the shoppers. Brand-awareness-centric ad types like Sponsored Brand Ads and Amazon DSP can be particularly beneficial for brands who want to increase brand awareness. Apart from advertising, there are several other options that can help you build brand awareness in the times of coronavirus:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="Amazon Storefront" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/"><b>Amazon Storefront</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This can be your dedicated destination to help your shoppers get familiar with your complete line of products. As mentioned above, it can be used as an alternative landing page for Sponsored Brand Ads.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Amazon Posts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just launched, </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/amazon-posts-make-your-marketing-strategy-more-social/"><strong>Posts</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the Instagram of Amazon. Brands can create social media-esque looking posts of their products on Amazon. Like a social media feed, shoppers can browse through different products, but Posts stand out because they are linked directly to the listing!</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>A+ Pages (</b><a title="Enhanced Brand Content" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/"><b>Enhanced Brand Content</b></a><b>):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The last thing you want at this time is that the shopper arrives at your product detail page and goes away because your product detail page couldn’t woo him. Investing in A+ Pages can help you skyrocket your conversion rates and, in the end, sales. A+ Pages also work to increase brand awareness.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>#7: Divert Your Advertising Efforts On Products That Help Them Stay-at-home</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12749" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11.jpg" alt="Advertising Efforts On Product" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay at home and work from home is the new normal. Apart from the “essential” products, now the demand for “new essentials” has erupted. </span><b>While people are buying toilet paper and sanitizers in a panic mode, they are also looking for products that can help them work from home, play at home, and products that can help them stay entertained when isolated because of the apparent reason that brick and mortar stores are closed for an uncertain period of time and even if they are open people are too scared to go in and buy. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes products such as fitness equipment, cosmetics, office essentials, kitchenware, home improvement, toys and other hobby related products. If any products in your catalog have an at-home use, divert some of your advertising expenses to those products.</span>
<h3>#8: Boost Conversion By Converting To FBM:</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12750" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/12.jpg" alt="Boost Conversion By Converting To FBM" width="476" height="103" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/12.jpg 476w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/12-300x65.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential that you keep a close watch on your conversion rates at the moment. You may already have seen a drop because of the out of stock label or delayed delivery time. To come out of this situation, you can make a switch to FBA. This will not only give you a reliable fulfillment option but also increase the probability of winning the Buy Box</span><b>. Amazon has shown to favor the FBM listings by increasing its organic ranking and even by helping them win the Buy Box.</b>
<h3>#9: High CPC Is Normal</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12751" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13.png" alt="High CPC Is Normal" width="1332" height="435" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13.png 1332w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13-600x196.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13-300x98.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13-1024x334.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13-768x251.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1332px) 100vw, 1332px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CPC rates are touching the sky at the moment, but they will undoubtedly lower because the competition will most likely decrease because of the supply chain challenges. This means that new opportunities will open up for brands who are in stock or are selling through FBM. If <b>you increase the ad spend now, you will be in a favorable position once everything normalizes. </b>Download the bulk campaign file and review keywords with high conversion rates, low CPC and those within your targeted ACOS. If you have the budget, set a competitive bid on them and try to include such related keywords in your campaign.</span>
<h3>#10: Hire <a title="Amazon PPC Experts" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon PPC Experts</a> For Better Profitability</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12752" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14.jpg" alt="Hire Amazon PPC Experts" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the reports, the global e-commerce market was 2.3 trillion USD in 2017 and projected to 4.48 trillion USD by 2021. Therefore, it is very imperative for online sellers to stay up to date with the most-recent inclination in the market to be and stay in the best in the game. There are a lot of trends coming up in the eCommerce market; you cannot pick on all of them. To be in the e-commerce business for a long run and to scale your eCommerce business to different marketplaces, you need to be smart enough to filter the finest.</p>
<p>Hopping from one marketplace to two or more requires a planning and strategy. Sellers can take help <a title="Amazon product optimization" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon product optimization</a> specialist like eStore Factory to scale your eCommerce business to other marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong><u>Steal the Deal</u></strong><br />
If you want to pull more crowds, you have to offer discounts and deals on your products. Discounts can act as bait for the customers. For increasing Amazon product optimization, they also adopted the Subscribe and Save option. Nearly 54% of buyers would like to purchase the product if the discount is offered. Discounts on subscription would also help you scale your eCommerce Business.</p>
<p><strong><u>Market Presence</u></strong><br />
Even the best of the products will pine away if customers are unaware of your products. When the customer search, your product should pop up and make its presence feel in the market. How can you buy something you cannot see?</p>
<p>Therefore, you will have to come up with a marketing plan (SEO and Social Media Marketing) that will be apt for your product. About 86% of women visit social media before purchasing.</p>
<p><strong><u>Divide Your Work</u></strong><br />
You have to keep in mind that you cannot do all the work alone. You will have to hire different people and delegate your work if you have to scale your business. Distributing your work becomes a little difficult because our feelings are attached to it and because we have done everything on our own till now. However, that would be the best thing to do in order to develop. You can outsource the <a title="Amazon SEO service" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon SEO service</a> or optimization of a product list to the experts.</p>
<p>The rationale is to hew down on man hours spent doing minuscule and arduous tasks that someone else can do and dedicate more time to the intricate nuances of your business.</p>
<p><strong><u>Customer Feedback</u></strong><br />
The customer is the king. Building a long-term relationship with the customer becomes difficult in the virtual world. You do not get to meet the buyer in person, so impressing by personality will not be an option. All that will matter is your product and the way you react to customer feedback, whether good or bad. Nearly 77% of buyers read the reviews before purchasing.</p>
<p>Tailor-made offers, emails, and rating systems are some things that you can consider staying in the lead in the customer service game.<br />
As your business will develop, the unsatisfied customers will also grow. Nevertheless, it is how you deal with it makes a difference.</p>
<p><strong><u>Personal Website</u></strong><br />
Whether you sell your products on Amazon or hire an eBay specialist consultant, it is important to have your own website.
