										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve heard about SEO. You’re convinced it has tremendous benefits. You know it works well for all kinds of businesses. What you probably wonder is whether your business needs it or not. We are 100% sure your site needs SEO. No matter what business you are in, if you have a website, you need SEO. It’s a necessity – just like your body needs water to survive, your business needs SEO to survive &amp; thrive. Many businesses spend a fortune building a “state-of-the-art” website and want SEO as the “cherry on the top”. That’s not how things work. These days everyone “Googles it”. If you’re not there, right on the top, good luck getting more sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re still unsure, here are some tell-tale signs your business probably needs an <a title="Professional SEO Consulting" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/professional-seo-services-company/">Professional SEO Consulting</a> company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#1: Your website isn’t ranking on Google</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69026" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-3.jpg" alt="Your website isn’t ranking on Google" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-3.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-3-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-3-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-3-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-3-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-3-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-3-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>While the list is not organized in terms of importance, your business not ranking on Google is a significant reason to invest in SEO. If your website isn’t appearing on page 1, it’s not getting enough exposure. There’s a saying in the SEO world, “The best place to hide a dead body is really on the 2nd page of Google search results”. It’s because 91.5% of clicks occur on the first page of search results, and the rest of the pages only get a slender 8.5% of clicks. If your website isn’t organically ranking, then you are missing out on a bigger chunk of traffic, leads and potential sales. Now that nobody wants to be on page 2 or beyond, you might be wondering: How do I get on page 1? You already know: Hire. An. Experienced. <a title="SEO Expert" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/professional-seo-services-company/">SEO Expert</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#2: There’s a drop in the traffic</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69027" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1.jpg" alt="There’s a drop in the traffic" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-1-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Are you seeing a decrease in sales, inquiry calls or form submissions? No traffic or low traffic can be frustrating. After all, when you have invested tons of time and efforts into building a website, you’ll want to give it the attention it needs and deserves. There are several reasons for a sudden dip in the traffic: outdated content, low page loading speed, technical issues, a penalty from Google for violating any quality guidelines and more. Don’t worry; it’s never too late to turn things around. A well though SEO strategy can help you gain relevant traffic on your website (relevant being the keyword here!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#3: Your website has little or no content</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69028" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2.jpg" alt="Your website has little or no content" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-2-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Great graphics, beautiful sliders and enticing banners will make your website more attractive but that ain’t gonna appeal to Google’s algorithm. Content is the king when it comes to SEO, and it’s a convenient way to boost your website’s visibility. That’s because content is the best place to add key search terms or “keywords” that people type in Google’s search bar. Whether you have an informational or e-commerce site, you want your website to rank higher for appropriate search terms, and your copy is the perfect space to slip in a few relevant and high volume keywords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#4: You are missing out on crucial page rank opportunities</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69020" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1.jpg" alt="You are missing out on crucial page rank opportunities" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Internal linking helps your visitors easily explore more pages of your site, thereby improving navigation. For example, linking from a blog post to a relevant product or service page is a great way to send some extra traffic on the service page. The internal link structure makes it convenient for the visitors to navigate through the site and helps the bots evaluate the importance of each page when they crawl your site. A healthy and well architecture internal linking structure can pass the “link juice” to relevant pages for seamless navigation from one page to another. And how can your website have a better internal linking structure? You probably know by now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#5: Your website takes an eternity to load</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69021" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-1.jpg" alt="Your website takes an eternity to load" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-1-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-1-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-1-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-1-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-1-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Nothing turns off a customer more than slow website loading speed. About 40% of the customers will abandon the site if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. But slow loading speed doesn’t just offset the shoppers; it upsets Google too. If your website page loading speed is low, there’s no way you’re going to rank high in Google’s SERPs. Back in 2010, Google started using loading speed as one of the ranking factors. In 2018, Google doubled down the importance of page speed by including mobile page loading speed as one of the factors that affect ranking on mobile devices. And in May 2020, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience">Google announced a new update in its algorithm</a> that’ll gauge web pages based on the page experiences. This experience includes mobile compatibility, HTTPS security and page loading speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#6: Bounce rate is soaring</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69022" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-3.jpg" alt="Bounce rate is soaring" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-3.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-3-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-3-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-3-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-3-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-3-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-3-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Bounce rate means the number of visitors who land on your website but leave without engaging with any other pages. Your website’s bounce rates can be easily found in your Google Analytics reports. If your web design and products are strong, but you aren’t getting the results, it clearly means you need SEO. Generally, a bounce rate of 40-50% is acceptable as it indicates that the rest 50-60% of the visitors chose to stick around and interact. There are a number of reasons for sky-high bounce rates, some of which are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor user experience</li>
<li>Lack of mobile optimization</li>
<li>Low page loading speed</li>
<li>Lack of informative content</li>
<li>Faulty functionality</li>
<li>Chaotic and non-user friendly web design</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#7: Your competitors are getting more sales</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-69023" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-1.jpg" alt="Your competitors are getting more sales" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-1-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-1-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-1-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-1-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-1-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Some sellers make their own website rather than selling on Amazon, thinking that they’ll face less competition. That’s not the case, actually. Your customers always have a choice. If your website isn’t ranking high, you aren’t getting your fair share of the pie – no matter how low your prices are or how good your product is. The seats on the 1st page of Google SERP are limited and thus, valuable. And if you are not leveraging SEO, you’re behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a title="SEO Optimization" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/professional-seo-services-company/">SEO optimization</a> is a marathon and not a sprint</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you are ranking high today doesn’t mean you don’t need SEO. Everyone from Apple to Nike has an <a title="SEO Services Company" href="https://www.estorefactory.com.au/seo-services/">SEO Services Company</a> working tirelessly to maintain their 1st-page positions. And you need it too. Most businesses look at it as a way to cut costs and find cheaper options. But that won’t “save your money”. Instead, you’ll end up losing more money. SEO isn’t an expense but an investment that, when done right, will pay for itself. Find a partner that goes beyond keyword optimization and link building. Find someone more experienced who knows the nitty gritty of Google SEO, and you’ll win through in the end.</p>

<p><strong><em>It’s that time of the year again, the sun’s bright as usual and the days are longer as usual but….nothing feels normal. Yes, it’s that time of the year again, but things have changed now, for everyone. </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some of us, the first half of 2020 was the most profitable in history, for some depressing and for most frustrating. No matter in which situation you were in, two months from now would be completely different. Being an Amazon seller, getting perplexed isn’t an option; you need to be prepared for what may come. And so this is the time you should forget about what happened and focus on what you can do to make everything right for your Amazon store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You had no time to plan for the unexpected pandemic but you can for the upcoming holidays. For the second half of 2020, you should have a laser-like focus on keeping your <em>clientele</em> satisfied, maximizing profits and protecting your business operation. However, for this year, you won’t have to prepare for the obvious things that may happen (sales jump) but also for the not-so-obvious things that <em>might</em> happen (supply channel disruptions). The action plan and guidelines you had for last year won’t work this year, so it is necessary that you start everything from the beginning. In this week’s blog post, I have rounded up some tips that will help you fine-tune your Amazon store for the “new normal” and be prepared for the unknown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#1: It’s Never Too Early To Start</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13584" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1.jpg" alt="It’s Never Too Early To Start" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
As it is rightly said, “Every Battle Is Won Before It’s Even Fought”. The same is true for Q3 and A4. The year is full of uncertainties, so be sure to prepare three times better and stay prepared for unexpected plot twists out of nowhere. What if there is a logistic upset occurring again, what if Amazon decides to pause the lightning deals? Are you and your Amazon store prepared for these situations? If not, now is the right to time to do it. It’s up to you to be ready for anything the year brings on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, this would be the best moment to let your customers know about the fantastic products you have in your store. This way, your brand will be on the top of the mind of the customer during the discount period. <strong>The early bird gets the worm so you should have an action plan ready with you. If you don’t have it ready yet, ask your <em><a title="Amazon Professional" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon Professional</a></em>. Never be left behind just because you didn’t take steps when you had the time for it.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#2: Lightning Deals &amp; Coupons Are The Star Of The Show</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13585" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="Coupons Are The Star Of The Show" width="1096" height="521" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png 1096w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-600x285.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-300x143.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-768x365.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1096px) 100vw, 1096px" /></p>
<p>These traffic-driving deals are a big draw in Q3 and Q4, especially in the holidays and sale days like Prime Day, Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday. If you have any excess or slow moving stock that is costing you money in the warehouses, then lighting deals is the best way to get rid of it. Plus lightning deals will get you better visibility and sales than any other form of advertising. However, there is an eligibility criteria for lightning deals so you must submit them to Amazon. The lightning deals submission date for Prime Day is 10th July. While lightning deals are essential for bringing in the traffic, coupons will help you to delight the customers and increase conversions. Use both in conjunction and see your sales skyrocket in the next few months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#3: If You Missed On Lightning Deals, Try Sale Price</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13586" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3.png" alt="You Missed On Lightning Deals" width="1142" height="545" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3.png 1142w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-600x286.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-300x143.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-1024x489.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1142px) 100vw, 1142px" /><br />
In Q3 and especially Q4, apart from Sponsored Products and <a title="Sponsored Brand Ads" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Sponsored Brand ads</a>, sellers also tend to utilize Lightning Deals and Coupons for better conversions and sales. However, the time is different now and so is Amazon’s priority. Many reports have claimed that Amazon is trying to sell less. <strong>In fact, in the last month, they had completely disabled the ability to create coupons and removed the deals page from its home page. In case, if such a situation arises again, you can always offer sales price on your listing. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#4: Your PPC Strategy Will Change Too</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13587" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4.png" alt="PPC Strategy Will Change Too" width="1336" height="400" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4.png 1336w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-600x180.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-300x90.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1024x307.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-768x230.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1336px) 100vw, 1336px" /><br />
The next few months are going to be full off increased traffic, clicks and sales. And because Amazon will see higher traffic, don&#8217;t hesitate to increase your budget. In the same way, accept that high ACOS is okay too. What you need to keep in mind is that you target your ad campaigns with relevant keywords which drives traffic that converts. For that, you will need a thorough <a title="Amazon Keyword Research" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-keyword-research/">Amazon Keyword Research</a> done by experts. Make sure you include each and every product in your catalog in your campaigns, none of them should be missed out. You can also make separate campaigns for high performing and low performing ASINs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#5: Try Building A “Local” Community</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13588" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.jpg" alt="Try Building A Local Community" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
#shoplocal, #shopsmall, #supportlocalbusiness are trending these days. Shopper’s mindset is drastically changing and at the same time, they are looking at your brand differently. People want to purchase from businesses through which they feel they are contributing a little in these times. If your product is Made In The USA or if your brand is contributing a part of the sales in the charity, don’t miss to highlight this point. Moreover, try to build a sort of relationship with your customer. The more a customer feels connected with you and trusts you as a brand, the more likely are they to purchase from you. There are many ways with which you can “build a community”. You can increase your presence on the social media account, run an email campaign, write blogs and engage the audience or share Social Media Promo Codes to bring outside traffic on Amazon. You can also try a contest where shoppers can post a photo of a product in use.</p>

<h2>#6: Never Put Your Eggs In One Basket: Use FBA, But Also Find An Alternative</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13589" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.jpg" alt="Never Put Your Eggs In One Basket" width="676" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.jpg 676w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><br />
Everyone agrees: FBA is a boon for Amazon sellers. Sellers could ship and fulfil the product with no effort on their side. Sellers were so much reliant on FBA that some of them didn’t even have an alternate fulfilment option ready with them. In March, when Amazon prioritized the shipment of essential items, sellers were into a dilemma as to what should be there next move. The shipments were delayed and the delivery dates showed two months even to the Prime Sellers. Owing to delayed deliveries, many sellers got negative reviews on their listing. Don’t make this mistake again. The uncertain times aren’t over yet; they have just begun. If Amazon gets overwhelmed during the high sales day, it may <strong><em>again</em></strong> take this decision to delay shipments. You don’t want to happen, do you? Try FBM; Seller Fulfilled Prime or other 3PL options for a few months. Also, make sure you have adequate stock for the upcoming holidays. Popular products sell like hotcakes and they will too this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#7: Change The Way You Present Your Products</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13590" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.jpg" alt="Change The Way You Present Your Products" width="676" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7.jpg 676w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><br />
Customer’s buying preference has completely changed. Those buying makeup products are now looking for face packs and skincare essentials, shoppers buying a car sunshade are now looking for products that can help them work from home. Similarly, their gifting choices would also change, instead of giving a BBQ set, shoppers might think of giving a phone sanitizer. Identify how your product can be useful to people in these times and try to incorporate that in your listing content, images and ad creatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#8 Look For Traffic Beyond Amazon</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13591" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.jpg" alt="Look For Traffic Beyond Amazon" width="676" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.jpg 676w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><br />
Product unavailability in brick and mortar stores has pushed online businesses 10 years into the future. Social distancing and fear have compelled the shoppers to purchase online. Experts suggest that the paradigm shift in this behavioral pattern is going to last even after the stores open. For online seller like you, that means more and more people will now make a habit to buy everything from grocery to luxury online. To capitalize on it, you should find ways to bring off-Amazon traffic. Share your gleaming 5-star reviews on social media, upload your product videos to YouTube, share your Amazon product page link on your blog or guest blogs, or advertise your products with the help of influencers; social media influencers are the in-thing these days.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#9: Keep A Check On Reviews</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13592" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.jpg" alt="Keep A Check On Reviews" width="676" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9.jpg 676w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /><br />
The negative reviews and returns this year has hit an all-time high and they will even go higher during the holiday season. And if you are not using FBA, you will face more trouble handling everything single-handedly. During the high-sales period, if your listing has a bunch of negative reviews and ratings, then it won’t just harm your account health but dramatically reduce conversions. This is the last thing you want to now. Start fixing the reviews from today. Go to your listings, make a detailed list of negative reviews and find the reason. Be transparent with your customers and explain the situation. Try giving them a refund and ask them to remove the review. Don’t forget to check your seller feedback as well. Also, try to get increase the reviews with the help of tools or email campaigns. Before the holiday season begins, make sure you have better (and more) ratings and reviews and you will see a real uptick in conversions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#10: Break No Rules</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13593" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10.jpg" alt="Break No Rules" width="676" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10.jpg 676w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></p>
<p>You want to avoid any flags on your account. Because of COVID-19, the retail giant has made enormous changes in its TOS. Remember when Amazon used to block listings if it had <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/your-product-is-not-a-pesticide-it-got-blocked/">pesticide</a> word written in it, even if it was an electronic item? Yes, Amazon bots are just a bunch of idiots. The same can happen again, even if Amazon suspects that you are price gouging or the quality of the product is deteriorated, then your account can be suspended. And I am not saying it just like that; I have seen such instance in recent time where a huge Amazon seller’s account got suspended just because a customer doubted its authenticity. And they were brand registered sellers. And they are having a hard time having the account reinstated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More recently there are multiple sellers complaining about their listings getting blocked because of an unknown reason. Upon researching, I came to know that any certification or claim without proof can get your listing blocked. For example, Claims like FDA approved or GMP certified. Some of the listings that were blocked the Best Selling products. If you are not careful and updated, you would also be in the list of the unfortunate sellers. Starting from June 1, Amazon has also restarted tracking and suspending selling accounts with high cancellation rate, late shipment rate, or order defect rate. If you want to make the most of Q3 and A4, make sure your account health is up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>All The Best For The Good Times Ahead!</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13594" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11.jpg" alt="All The Best For The Good Times Ahead" width="676" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11.jpg 676w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-600x399.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></p>
<p>All I would like to say is that start the next half of 2020 on a good note and with a positive mindset. Don’t cut down on efforts just because you are not getting the results instantly. In fact, this is the time to double or triple your efforts. If the prediction of the e-commerce boom is accurate, Amazon sellers are going to be in a great place a few years from now. And if you are successful in positioning your business right now, you could actually have the best time of your life in the future. To ensure the success in Q3 and Q4 consider hiring professional <a title="Amazon consultants" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon consultants</a> from experienced Amazon Agency like eStore Factory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>On a scale of 1-10, how important is keyword research for Amazon products? 100!</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is a search engine and search engines function on keywords. No keywords, no ranking. Forgetting an important keyword is like forgetting your wallet in the restaurant: in short, you are losing money. Because if you are not adding essential keywords in your listing, then your product won’t be found via search. The catch here is that you are not going to find the list of best keywords at one place. The key here is to conduct old-fashioned multi source keyword research. Here are some of the techniques we use to create incredibly powerful and successful Amazon listings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#1: Read Amazon’s Brain</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13300" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png" alt="Read Amazon’s Brain" width="1346" height="460" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.png 1346w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-600x205.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-300x103.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1024x350.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-768x262.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1346px) 100vw, 1346px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Google, Amazon too suggests search terms whenever a customer types in the search bar. These suggested terms are not arbitrarily generated; rather, Amazon displays the most common search terms in the suggestions. Those keywords actually have more volume and weightage than you think. Why? Shoppers are lazy. They don’t bother to type the whole thing, as soon as the suggestions appear they instantly click on that. So while doing keyword research, you must not miss out on these crucial keywords. Include them in your title, bullets and description and look how useful they are. There is just one downfall of this approach. Since the suggested terms are all over the place, you might have a hard time sorting and refining them out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: You can also use the keywords suggested on Google and Youtube as the keywords from these platforms fares well on Amazon too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#2: What Does Your Frequently Bought Together Section Say?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13301" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1.png" alt="amazon keyword research services" width="934" height="294" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1.png 934w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-600x189.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-300x94.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-768x242.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The “frequently bought together section” displays the items that customers usually buy together. The line of thought here is that if the customers are buying a coffee machine, they might also want to buy coffee pods. By using the keywords related to the product displayed in the “frequently bought together section”, you can bring your product in front of the customers who aren’t necessarily looking for your product. This way your product will be on the top of the mind of the customers, in case in future they decide to buy a product similar to yours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#3: It’s Time To Meet Your Good Ol’ Friend Long Tail Keywords</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13648 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-4.jpg" alt="amazon keyword research" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-4.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-4-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-4-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The simplest way to identify long-tail keywords is: find the keywords with three or more words. The next question, why are they so important? When you want to buy a shampoo, will you write shampoo in the search bar or you would write Shampoo + Brand Name or Shampoo + For Your Hair Type or Shampoo + Your Hair Concern. See, now you know why long-tail keywords are unmissable. Most of the <a title="Amazon listing optimization" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/">Amazon listing optimization</a> experts choose to ignore them, not knowing that almost ¾ of the online searches consist of long-tail keywords. Moreover, long-tail keywords bring better conversions, because customers didn’t come across your product while casually browsing, he/she actually wanted a product EXACTLY like yours. Next time you do keyword research, never ever ignore your long-tail keywords, instead add them in your copy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#4: Don’t Run After Volume, Run After Competitiveness (And Relevance)</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13649 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-3.jpg" alt="Best amazon keyword research" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-3.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-3-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-3-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes more, the merrier is not always true, especially when it comes to your keyword volume. As we discussed long-tail keywords, there is no point in using a highly competitive and short term as your main keyword. If you are selling Vitamin C Serum, it won’t be right to use a serum as the main keyword. You won’t rank for that and the conversions will dramatically decrease. Look for keywords that are high/medium volume with low competition. Yes, I agree it’s not that easy, but you will surely find some good keywords with patience, perseverance and common sense. Speaking of competition…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#5: Don’t Reinvent The Wheel &#8211; Analyze Your Competitor’s Listing</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-13646 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-4.jpg" alt="amazon keyword research service" width="1005" height="1210" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-4.jpg 1005w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-4-600x722.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-4-249x300.jpg 249w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-4-851x1024.jpg 851w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-4-768x925.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1005px) 100vw, 1005px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another keyword source that should never underestimate is your competitor’s product. Find your top 5 competitors or find the top 5 listings ranking on page 1. Thoroughly analyze their listing and most importantly, their title. What keywords are they using in their bullets and description? Look at the formation of their title and try to make your title similarly. You gotta have the words mentioned in their title in your title. Another way to get an edge is by conducting a Reverse ASIN search.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#6: Use An Amazon Specific Keyword Tool</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13305" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png" alt="Amazon Specific Keyword Tool" width="1351" height="428" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.png 1351w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-600x190.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-300x95.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1024x324.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-768x243.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1351px) 100vw, 1351px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just guesswork won’t work here. You need to make reliable data-driven decisions. And that’s where keyword research tools help you. Just enter the seed keyword and get a massive list of related keywords along with their search volume, seasonal trends and much more. This data insight will help you make the right decision. When it comes to keyword research tools, nothing can beat the excellence of Merchant Words and Helium10. There are many other free tools available but trust me; they aren’t worth your time and efforts. At eStore Factory, we conduct keyword research from these two tools and our clients, or we are never disappointed. These two tools are paid, but you always buy our Keyword Research to reap the benefits of these two tools and our expertise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#7: Leverage Sponsored Ads:</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13306" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png" alt="keyword research service:" width="1255" height="370" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.png 1255w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-600x177.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-300x88.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1024x302.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-768x226.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1255px) 100vw, 1255px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">PPC Ads are a great place to data-mine keywords. Your automatic ad campaigns are a relatively simple and fail-proof way to find new search terms and determine the relevancy of the keywords. After running automatic campaigns for one week or more, download the Search Term report and identify the keywords used by the shoppers. You can see the number of impressions the keyword got vs the number of clicks and sales. Prioritize the keywords based on the conversion rates because, in the end, that is what matters the most.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#8: Set The Priority:</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13307" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-1.jpg" alt="keyword research services for amazon" width="700" height="400" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-1.jpg 700w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-1-600x343.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-1-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your product title is the primary spot for placing the seed keywords and other top keywords. Then comes the bullet points and description. Unlike the common notion, keywords added in bullet points and description won’t be indexed for organic ranking; they are used for Sponsored Ad campaigns. Lastly, populate the fields in your backend, which is explained in detail in the next point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#9: Product Backend &#8211; The Most Ignored (And Important) Part</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13308" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-1.png" alt="keyword research services" width="916" height="1044" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-1.png 916w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-1-600x684.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-1-263x300.png 263w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-1-898x1024.png 898w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-1-768x875.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot include all the keywords in your listing, but you still want to rank for them. Here’s when the lesser-known backend keywords can help you. You can add up to 249 characters in your backend search terms. Your shoppers cannot see those keywords, but Amazon can. If you want to know if your backend keywords are indexed or not, copy the entire string and paste in the search bar. If any related products appear then the keywords are indexed. Adding backend keywords isn’t just enough. You should also fill the Subject Matter, Other Attributes, Target Audience and Intended Use fields. They will further help Amazon to bring your listing in front of the right audience. Most of the sellers ignore these fields, which is so wrong. When you buy Product Listing Optimization service from eStore Factory, you don’t just get optimized title, bullets and description but also information needed to populate all the fields in the backend.</span></p>

<h2><strong>#10: Fine Tune Your Keyword Research Frequently</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13309" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png" alt="Keyword Research amazon" width="1348" height="383" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.png 1348w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-600x170.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-300x85.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-1024x291.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-768x218.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" /><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Any big holiday or sale coming up? Use related keywords in your copy and add a few in your advertising campaigns. Yes, I understand that your copy and backend fields are already jam-packed with keywords, but try to make some room to wedge a few holiday or gift keywords, especially if your product is a highly sought after item in the holidays. Try searching for “Christmas Gift” or “Prime Day Deals” in keyword tools and you will be amazed at the search volume.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FAQs:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q1: What Are Platinum Keywords?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">These keywords are added by the merchants having a platinum account. Platinum status is offered to the sellers having extraordinary sales threshold. Using platinum keywords allow sellers to customize the product’s structure in such a way that the shoppers will view while visiting the storefront. There is no point in filling the platinum keyword field unless and until you are a platinum merchant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q2: Which Keyword Tools Are Best For Keyword Research?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At eStore Factory, we use Merchant Words and Helium10 and we think these two tools are enough for all your keyword needs. The data is presented along with the monthly search volume, trends, and much more. However, there are other reliable tools as well like Jungle Scout’s Keyword Scout, Sonar, Keyword Inspector and KeywordIO.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q3: Should I Use Misspellings, brand names or ASINs?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not advisable. Amazon automatically corrects the misspelling keywords, so there is no point in adding them in your copy or search terms. If you add them in your copy, it will make you as a brand look unprofessional. If Amazon spots you using other brand names in your listing or backend, then it may block your listing. The choice is yours. For ASIN, there is absolutely no point in using ASINs; no customer is going to search for your product using ASINs and Amazon too takes into consideration the relevant keywords and not ASIN. My advice would be that don’t waste your valuable space in these things; it’s not worth it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q4: How To Know Which Keyword I Am Ranking For?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple. Type “ASIN + Keyword” in the search bar. If your product shows up in the search results, you are ranking for that keyword otherwise not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world has turned upside down. The massive shifts in the supply channels and the paradigm shift in customer behavior have left brands thinking as to what their next move should be. One of their biggest concerns is what they should do with their advertising campaigns not only for the coming few weeks but for the remainder of 2020. Sadly, there is no blanket strategy for this, but that doesn’t mean you should completely ignore your advertising efforts. It won’t be right to abandon Amazon Advertising, but at the same time, brands should rethink their strategies. Campaigns you crafted before the COVID-19 pandemic won’t be any more appropriate anymore. It’s time to take a close look at the situation and devise a new action plan. I have put together 10 useful tips that can help manage your advertising efforts in these tumultuous times. But first, it is essential that you stay updated on what’s new.</span>
<h2>Catching Up On The Coronavirus Updates:</h2>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12754" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2.jpg" alt="what’s new" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />
<h3>1) Amazon Is Affected Too:</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12755" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1.jpg" alt="Amazon Is Affected Too" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Coronavirus pandemic hasn’t just affected the sellers but the retail giant as well. Longer delivery times and restricted shipments had taken a toll on customer retention rates. In the worst weeks of April, Amazon received 800,000 negative reviews, which were double the amount in the last April. Because of the poor shopping experience, many of the customers switched to Walmart and Target for fulfilling their demands. But one thing remains true for sure – Amazon is an integral part of every shopper’s lives. Maybe the times are challenging and customers are wavering, but Amazon is a GIANT. So the sellers selling on Amazon are in a better position than others.</span>
<h3>2) Prime Day Submission Window Is Extended</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12756" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2.jpg" alt="Prime Day" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I had previously said that Amazon Prime Day had been delayed. The latest updates state that the deadline for accepting Prime Day Deals has been extended from 8th May to 5th June. This is a big relief to the sellers as they will now have more time to predict inventory and plan for the event.</span>
<h3>3) Deals Have Disappeared:</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12757" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4.png" alt="Deals Have Disappeared" width="1348" height="787" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4.png 1348w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-600x350.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-300x175.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-1024x598.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon has also suspended all the deals until any further notice. So, the deals that are already approved will run, but no new deals can be made and will be accepted. Sellers had planned many deals for upcoming holidays like Mother’s Day, but all the deals were rejected by Amazon. Amazon had also once removed Today’s Deal page and changed the look of its Homepage to feature Kindle eBooks and other Prime Video shows.</span>
<h2>10 Tips To Help You Manage Your Advertising Campaigns In The Times Of Coronavirus</h2>
<h3>#1: Stop Fretting, Start Acting</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12758" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-2.jpg" alt="Stop Fretting, Start Acting" width="675" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-2.jpg 675w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first and most important piece of advice in these unpredictable times would be: Don’t freak out. It’s not just you; everyone is seeing an uptick in ACOS and spend. Always remember </span><b>the base rule of PPC campaigns: longevity matters.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes, if your campaigns are costing you more than you can afford, go ahead and pause them. But if you are in a better situation, optimize your campaigns and not just once a week or month</span><b>. Micromanagement is a must</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>Change bid and budgets daily and add keywords from your search term report regularly. If your ACOS is spiking, don’t fret but pause any keywords that are not performing well. Review your campaigns at the product level;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if a particular ad or product has low conversion rates, high spend, or high ACOS, pause those ads until things calm down. Maintain a list of ads/keywords you have paused and rethink about them later.</span>
<h3>#2: Determine Your Demand</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12759" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1.jpg" alt="Determine Your Demand" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you hardly surviving, or are you thriving? The answer to this question will majorly help you determine your advertising strategy. Because of the pandemic, Amazon sellers are basically divided into two categories. First, the fortunate ones. This includes the sellers who have seen no surge or dip in their sales and the sellers who have seen a surge in sales because of the changing customer behavior. Second, the ones who are getting hammered. These are the ones who are worst affected by the pandemic. This includes the sellers selling beauty products (no one’s going out, right?) or luxury items. All your advertising strategies should be centered around your demand. If your business is thriving, go ahead as you normally would while also adapting to the new buying pattern. If you are struggling, go easy and focus your marketing efforts on the products in your catalog that fall under the thrive niche.</span>
<h3>#3: Stay In Stock:</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12760" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1.jpg" alt="Stay In Stock" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The reshuffling of fulfillment patterns has brought about unprecedented challenges for Amazon sellers selling through FBA. The initial weeks of March proved to be quite rough as Amazon imposed a ban on shipment and fulfillment of non-essential items and prioritized the shipment of six essential categories. This created two new worries for sellers: First, they were worried about the FBA fees they will have to pay because now the inventory will be just sitting in the warehouses and second, they were concerned about the lost sales. After all, even if the customer was willing to order, they were not able to ship the product. Although now, Amazon has recovered from “essentials only” there are still limits as to how much inventory sellers can ship into the warehouses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so surprisingly, there is a chunk of sellers who were highly benefited from this situation. For instance, the sellers selling essential items like groceries, toilet paper, or sanitizers. However, it turns out that those sellers were unprepared for the unexpected spike in sales because of which they faced inventory stockouts, despite the surge in demand. </span><b>No matter in which situation you are, at this point in time, until everything is back to normal, it would be best to find a reliable fulfillment option and Amazon is definitely not on the list. For a few months, convert your products to FBM and try to handle the fulfillment yourself.</b>
<h3>#4: Monitor Your Advertising Efforts As Per Your Inventory Levels</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12746" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.jpg" alt="Monitor Your Advertising Efforts" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/8-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scale your bids depending on your inventory levels and the capacity to restock in the future.</b> If you are going to go out of stock or are already not in stock, immediately pause your advertising efforts because you don’t want to take your customers to the out-of-stock product pages; this can dramatically decrease conversions. On the other hand, <b>you should be increasing your ad spend and budget while making sure you have sufficient inventory and a reliable fulfillment channel</b>. Your Sponsored Product, Display Ads and Sponsored Brand Ad campaigns will automatically pause and resume once you have stock.</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: If you want to utilize this time to build brand awareness and don’t think it’s right to pause <strong><a title="Amazon Sponsored Ads" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon Sponsored Ads</a></strong>, link your Sponsored Brand Ad campaigns to your storefront. This way, you can make sure your campaigns will run regardless of the inventory levels.</span></em>
<h3>#5: Fine Tune Your Content Strategy</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12747" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9.jpg" alt="Fine Tune Your Content Strategy" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a survey conducted by eMarketer, 77% of respondents said they wanted advertising to “talk about how the brand is helpful in the new everyday life,” 75% said it should “inform about the brand’s efforts to face the situation,” and 86% of US ad viewers were open to brands mentioning COVID-19 in their ads.</span></i> The mention of the current situation, how your product can help them cope with the situation or what the brand has contributed will appeal to the shoppers more than anything else. <strong>Try to incorporate such sentences or keywords in your content. Just make sure that it’s all as per Amazon’s requirements. The key here is to stay relevant, original, creative and mindful of Amazon’s rules.</strong>
<h3>#6: Now Is The Time To Build Brand Awareness</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12748" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.jpg" alt="Time To Build Brand Awareness" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the customer may be shopping less for now, but they are still there, browsing on the site, randomly adding items into the cart to buy in the future. </span><b>Invest in brand-awareness campaigns and leverage the browsing traffic to reach new customers and to keep your products in the top-of-mind of the customers.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Analyze the new-to-brand metrics use this data for retargeting the shoppers. Brand-awareness-centric ad types like Sponsored Brand Ads and Amazon DSP can be particularly beneficial for brands who want to increase brand awareness. Apart from advertising, there are several other options that can help you build brand awareness in the times of coronavirus:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="Amazon Storefront" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/"><b>Amazon Storefront</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This can be your dedicated destination to help your shoppers get familiar with your complete line of products. As mentioned above, it can be used as an alternative landing page for Sponsored Brand Ads.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Amazon Posts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just launched, </span><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/amazon-posts-make-your-marketing-strategy-more-social/"><strong>Posts</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the Instagram of Amazon. Brands can create social media-esque looking posts of their products on Amazon. Like a social media feed, shoppers can browse through different products, but Posts stand out because they are linked directly to the listing!</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>A+ Pages (</b><a title="Enhanced Brand Content" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/"><b>Enhanced Brand Content</b></a><b>):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The last thing you want at this time is that the shopper arrives at your product detail page and goes away because your product detail page couldn’t woo him. Investing in A+ Pages can help you skyrocket your conversion rates and, in the end, sales. A+ Pages also work to increase brand awareness.</span></li>

<h3>#7: Divert Your Advertising Efforts On Products That Help Them Stay-at-home</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12749" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11.jpg" alt="Advertising Efforts On Product" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/11-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay at home and work from home is the new normal. Apart from the “essential” products, now the demand for “new essentials” has erupted. </span><b>While people are buying toilet paper and sanitizers in a panic mode, they are also looking for products that can help them work from home, play at home, and products that can help them stay entertained when isolated because of the apparent reason that brick and mortar stores are closed for an uncertain period of time and even if they are open people are too scared to go in and buy. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes products such as fitness equipment, cosmetics, office essentials, kitchenware, home improvement, toys and other hobby related products. If any products in your catalog have an at-home use, divert some of your advertising expenses to those products.</span>
<h3>#8: Boost Conversion By Converting To FBM:</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12750" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/12.jpg" alt="Boost Conversion By Converting To FBM" width="476" height="103" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/12.jpg 476w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/12-300x65.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential that you keep a close watch on your conversion rates at the moment. You may already have seen a drop because of the out of stock label or delayed delivery time. To come out of this situation, you can make a switch to FBA. This will not only give you a reliable fulfillment option but also increase the probability of winning the Buy Box</span><b>. Amazon has shown to favor the FBM listings by increasing its organic ranking and even by helping them win the Buy Box.</b>
<h3>#9: High CPC Is Normal</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12751" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13.png" alt="High CPC Is Normal" width="1332" height="435" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13.png 1332w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13-600x196.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13-300x98.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13-1024x334.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13-768x251.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1332px) 100vw, 1332px" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">CPC rates are touching the sky at the moment, but they will undoubtedly lower because the competition will most likely decrease because of the supply chain challenges. This means that new opportunities will open up for brands who are in stock or are selling through FBM. If <b>you increase the ad spend now, you will be in a favorable position once everything normalizes. </b>Download the bulk campaign file and review keywords with high conversion rates, low CPC and those within your targeted ACOS. If you have the budget, set a competitive bid on them and try to include such related keywords in your campaign.</span>
<h3>#10: Hire <a title="Amazon PPC Experts" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon PPC Experts</a> For Better Profitability</h3>
<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12752" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14.jpg" alt="Hire Amazon PPC Experts" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no denying to the fact that Amazon is an uber-competitive marketplace. There is competition at every point. Competition to rank on the first page, the competition to be seen more, competition for price, competition for better images. It can be difficult for small sellers to survive, forget the thriving part. However, one of the ways sellers use to reach a broader spectrum of audience is through <strong><a title="Amazon Sponsored Ads" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon Sponsored Ads</a> </strong>or PPC. The affordable and easy to use tool is utilized by multi-million dollar Amazon brands as well as the 3rd party sellers. But now this advertising tool seems to take a toll on the hard-working organic results and you might be one of them who is affected. There have been two such instances in recent times:</span></p>
<h2><strong>#1: Demotion Of Organic Search Results</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon&#8217;s search result pages are increasingly showing paid results in prominent places. For searches in high competitive categories, there are no organic results in the first line of the search result page. The first line is jam-packed, with only the sponsored results. Until the customer scrolls down the Sponsored Brand Ads, <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com.au/amazon-sponsored-ads/">Sponsored Product Ads</a> and Our Brand label of Amazon, they find the organic search results. Most customers don&#8217;t actually bother to go this down and usually find their ideal product right from the first line of the product.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12299" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1.jpg" alt="Sponsored Product Ads" width="1813" height="1579" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1.jpg 1813w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1-600x523.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1-300x261.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1-1024x892.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1-768x669.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1-1536x1338.jpg 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-1-1568x1366.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is said that Amazon has unlimited shelf space. But in this &#8220;unlimited&#8221; shelf space, the most profitable position is the #1 page of the search results. There may be over 1,00,000 hemp supplements available on Amazon, but amongst them only the first 120 will be seen by 99% of the customers. Others would simply lie there on the 2nd, 3rd or the 10th page. By demoting the organic results, Amazon is not only losing the trust of hard-working sellers but also demoting the consumer experience. How? If you notice carefully on the below picture, the products on the first line of the search result page don&#8217;t even have great reviews. Naturally, the customers who used these products didn&#8217;t have a great time. While exactly below the organic results seem to have some great products from reliable brands. They have great reviews, better ratings and a professional main image. It is clear that by tempering with the search results, they are ruining their impression in the long run.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12301" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpg" alt="organic results seem" width="1729" height="1746" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpg 1729w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1-100x100.jpg 100w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1-600x606.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1-297x300.jpg 297w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1-1014x1024.jpg 1014w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1-768x776.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1-1521x1536.jpg 1521w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1-1568x1583.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1729px) 100vw, 1729px" /></p>
<h2><strong>#2: Replacing Of Organic Product Suggestions With Sponsored Ads</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your battle doesn&#8217;t end after bringing a customer on your product detail page. Exactly below the product images and add to cart section and above the description and review section, you will find multiple rows of products similar to yours. They can be better than yours in terms of reviews and price so there is a possibility that those products are able to woo the shopper right from your product detail page. Up until now, these recommendations were selected by Amazon. But now they are being replaced with sponsored results. Sections like &#8220;Customers who bought this item also bought&#8221; are replaced with &#8220;Sponsored Products Related To This&#8221; Item, &#8220;Brands Related To This Category On Amazon,&#8221; and &#8220;4 stars and above&#8221; sections which are clearly paid positions. Visually there might be no difference in these paid sections and the previous organic sections, but otherwise, there is nothing the same.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Seems Like Paid Advertising Is Dominating Organic Efforts?</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12303" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-1.jpg" alt="Seems Like Paid Advertising Is Dominating Organic Efforts" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/4-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Market Pulse, brands and retailers selling on Amazon will spend as much as 9.85 billion dollars on advertising in the US alone. Almost 4% of the total sales earned on Amazon are through paid advertising. Amazon may still be smaller than Google and Facebook when it comes to advertising, but sellers cannot ignore the fact that ad conversion rates on Amazon are much higher than ANY other platform. Reason? The audience viewing your ad on Amazon is genuine shoppers with concrete purchase intent. This is the reason why bids set on Amazon are much higher than any other advertising platform because your ad is more likely to convert. And amongst all the ad formats available on Amazon, Sponsored Ads are responsible for the maximum amount of ad spend on Amazon. They are easy to set up and if made the right way, they can bring your product on the first page. This is why ALL the Amazon sellers use it. And Amazon too, finding Sponsored Ads profitable seems to favor them more, which is why sellers are experiencing a partial behavior mentioned previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon&#8217;s customer-centric approach is the gold standard in the online retail world and it has been used as an example by all the competitors. To give its customer the best experience possible, it never used to temper with the organic results. The search result positions were based on paid advertisement + editorial recommendation. But nowadays it seems to be fading. Instead of relying on factors like relevancy, its prioritizing products based on ad spend. Indeed it will be difficult for sellers who were already ranking high but are now ignored because the world&#8217;s most customer-centric company is now chasing advertisement profits. You might be thinking that what&#8217;s the point in spending dollars on optimizing the listing and images? All that matters is PPC. Well, this is not completely true. And here are some of the reasons to prove it to you why organic efforts still matter.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Here&#8217;s Why It Would Be A Grave Mistake To Cut Down On The Organic Efforts:</strong></h2>
<h3><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12304" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-1.jpg" alt="Organic Efforts" width="1156" height="305" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-1.jpg 1156w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-1-600x158.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-1-300x79.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-1-1024x270.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-1-768x203.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1156px) 100vw, 1156px" /></h3>
<h3>#1: You Pay From Your Profits To Get A Sale</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know the woes of selling on Amazon. You pay for taxes, you pay for FBA, you pay for advertising and after all that, the profit you get is little. You cannot actually cut down on the taxes or FBA costs, but you can definitely do something about the money you spend on PPC. Try to reduce that and your profits will automatically increase.</span></p>
<h3>#2: Organic Efforts Are An Investment</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPC sales are an expense and organic sales are an investment that will bring dividends for years to come. You are paying for a position and it&#8217;s not confirmed whether you will earn a sale by being at that position or not. There is a possibility that customers clicks on the ad, views your product and do not buy the product. The money you spent is going to be wasted. While on the other hand, with organic ranking, you have got nothing to lose.</span></p>
<h3>#3: PPC Sale Increase &amp; Organic Sale Decrease Is Not A Good Sign</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although PPC seems to be a shortcut to achieve sales faster, it is not a permanent solution. It should be a way to help you rank higher. If your PPC sales are more than your organic sales right after the product launch, it is acceptable, but if the scenario remains the same, then it&#8217;s a warning bell. Your advertising sales should have a snowball effect. After sometime, it should lead to organic sales and brand awareness. So it won&#8217;t be right to just depend on paid sales just because it&#8217;s an &#8220;easy&#8221; way to get sales.</span></p>
<h3>#4: PPC Positions Are Not Permanent</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They change every day. Today you might be on the first page, but there is no guarantee you will be on the first page tomorrow or the day after tomorrow or after one month. New products are listed every day and bids are adjusted every day. Amazon being greedy for money, will only choose the products based on the bids. So after some time, you may lose the position at which you are now. While if your organic ranking is higher, you might be demoted, but Amazon won&#8217;t be able to completely take away your position.</span></p>
<h3>#5: Amazon SEO Is Critical For PPC&#8217;s Success</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever heard of<strong><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/is-your-product-retail-ready-how-to-prepare-for-it-drive-sales-2019/">retail readiness</a>?</strong> No amount of PPC efforts are going to help you if your product detail page isn&#8217;t ready for the traffic you bring. The most significant metric of your PPC campaigns and ads is conversion. If your overall conversion rate is low, the ACOS naturally will be high and the money you spent is going to be wasted. Before even starting your PPC campaigns, it is necessary that you make your product detail page customer-friendly.</span></p>
<h3>#6: Amazon&#8217;s Updated Algorithm Doesn&#8217;t Support PPC As It Used To</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you read my blog on Amazon&#8217;s<strong><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/amazon-a10-algorithm-update/">latest algorithm update</a>?</strong> It is believed that Amazon&#8217;s updated algorithm, widely known as A10, gives more importance to relevancy and not PPC. PPC used to be a significant deciding factors before and it was believed that more PPC sales can bring great results in organic ranking. But the situation has changed now. Amazon has understood that it would be best if the &#8220;most deserving product wins&#8221; and not the &#8220;most paying product.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe Amazon is partial; maybe with the changes in the updated algorithm, we may see a change in how the listings are positioned and ranked. But no matter what the situation is, you cannot ignore the fact that organic efforts <strong><em>never go in vain</em></strong>. It might sound to cliché, but it&#8217;s actually true. At the same time, I am not telling you to completely stop PPC; that would be insane. Try to maintain a healthy balance between the both – just make sure PPC sales don&#8217;t overpower your organic sales. And if you need any help in increasing any of the two sales, then feel free to contact us.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More traffic and more sales, gosh, that&#8217;s every online retailer&#8217;s dream. But not every retailer can live this dream. You spent years choosing a great product catalog and you built a website that&#8217;s just wow. The easy part is over. Phew! Now all you need to do is drive traffic because, without traffic, your website will be like the sound of one hand clapping (in short, nothing). But this is easier said than done. How do you begin? With so many ways available, how can we identify which one&#8217;s right for you and which one&#8217;s not. Besides, just bringing in traffic isn&#8217;t enough; you need visitors that can be your potential customers. So before learning how to bring the traffic, it&#8217;s essential that you first understand the difference between traffic and quality traffic.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Released in 2002, Google Shopping was previously known as Froogle, where the service simply indexed the products based on certain search terms. From 2012, the service transformed into a paid advertising model where retailers can pay to get featured in the Google Shopping results. Since then, Google Shopping became a branch of Google AdWords, a new way for online sellers to advertise and sell their physical products.<strong> If you are not using Google shopping, then, believe me, you are missing out on huge sales opportunities. It works mostly because it appeals to the shoppers who are trying to purchase a product and are looking for the best deals all over the internet.</strong> More and more brands are using it because Google Shopping Ads has shown to have a 30% higher conversion rates than traditional text ads. <strong>Here are some best practices for brands to follow when they opt for Google Shopping:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The social media world is home to more than 3.4 billion active users. With so many users spending about 2 hours and 33 minutes per day browsing on social networking sites, brands cannot afford to ignore social media marketing. <strong>But creating a Facebook profile and posting one or two random photos a week isn&#8217;t enough anymore. You need to have an active and attractive profile for all the giant platforms like Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn.</strong> Apart from these platforms, you can use Pinterest to share visual content, Reddit to prove your knowledge in an industry, Tumblr to create a multimedia diary to support your website, Google+ to share your content on Google&#8217;s own platform and boost SEO and Snapchat to document behind-the-scenes of your business through video. <strong>You can use the below tips to drive website traffic by leveraging your social media account:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;It&#8217;s 2020 and no one uses emails&#8221; – said no one ever. Every person checks their mails the first thing in their morning and not their social media account and this is what makes email marketing a great way to drive traffic. <strong>Over the years, email marketing has withstood the test of time and is still the most profitable marketing medium. Because it&#8217;s inexpensive, it delivers a higher ROI per advertising dollar spent.</strong> And not to forget email marketing is extremely versatile. Marketers use emails to inform their existing subscribers or potential shoppers about the launch of their brand new product or to build a relation and spark an interest in their brand. As you can speak directly through their inbox, you can build a personal and long-lasting relationship with your prospects, leads, current customers, and even past customers. <strong>Here are some tips to effectively drive more traffic through email marketing:</strong></p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">#4: Perform On-Page SEO Optimization</h4>

<p style="text-align: left;">According to research conducted by HubSpot, 80% of website traffic begins with a search query. Right now, thousands of people are searching for content and product just like yours. You can help them find it with the help of SEO.<strong> Someone doesn&#8217;t need to know that your company exists right now, but if you have a great SEO strategy, you can still make them visit your website.</strong> This is the reason why on-page SEO is not just important but necessary. Once your website is ranking on the <strong><em>first page of Google</em></strong>, you will get more visibility and in turn more traffic, more conversions and more dollars of sales. Why set your goals for the first page? Because 75% of users don&#8217;t even click past the first page (making it a great place to hide a dead body :P). <strong>Take a look at some of the on-page SEO techniques for increasing web traffic:</strong></p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">#5: Focus Your Attention On Long Tail Keywords As Well</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9328" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26.jpg" alt="amazon seo experts" width="823" height="118" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26.jpg 823w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26-600x86.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26-300x43.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26-768x110.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Who doesn&#8217;t want to rank for keywords like &#8220;hair shampoo&#8221; and &#8220;maxi dress&#8221;? Although short terms like this are lucrative and attract high volume traffic, they&#8217;re actually difficult and if you are new in the SEO world, almost impossible to rank for, no matter how much you bid on them. On the other hand, long term keywords are much less competitive and effective. <strong>They may be unpopular and low volume but tend to convert really well.</strong> Take a look at the image below to understand better.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">#6: Start Blogging</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One blog means one more indexed page for your website, meaning you have one more opportunity to show up in the search results. To understand how blogging can help you get more traffic, you will have to consider the original purpose of the Internet and Google – information searching and sharing. Users visit a website because they find something that interests them. As simple as it may sound, most marketers forget this simple fact that visitors who are not engaged are far less likely to respond positively to a call to action. <strong>Creating content regularly also informs your search engines that your website is active and updated, so your chances of ranking higher organically increase, leading to more and more organic traffic. Here are some of the reasons that will motivate you to blog regularly:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9319" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/15-1.jpg" alt="amazon seo expert" width="676" height="247" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/15-1.jpg 676w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/15-1-600x219.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/15-1-300x110.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">#7: Use Influencer Marketing</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because of the insurmountable amount of noise in the online world, shoppers are skeptical for the brands who indulge in self-promotion. This is where influencer marketing can help.<strong> The beauty of influencer marketing is that the audience is already there, so you are advertising your product or service in front of a group of people who are already looking for your product.</strong> This is the biggest reason why conversions and traffic generated by influencer marketing is much higher than any other marketing medium. You don&#8217;t need to define a target market, or choose a specific strategy, all you have to do is finding the right influencer because his/her audience will already be interested in what the influencer posts. <strong>Here are some of the tips that can help you choose the right influencer for your brand:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your website is responsive when it can adapt and display content effectively regardless of the screen size and the platform users view it on. In short, your customers will have a seamless shopping experience whether they view your website on a mobile, laptop, tablet or desktop. No amount of marketing and traffic is going to help you if you don&#8217;t have a user-friendly website. <strong>If your customers have to pinch and scroll their way up and down through your website, in a way, you are telling them to go somewhere else.</strong> <strong>Google also penalizes the websites that are not responsive.</strong> Even if you have a basic website with no advanced features, you should make sure that it is easily accessible and comfortable to view across all the devices and especially smartphones. <strong>Follow these simple and effective tips to make your website responsive for all the devices:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Do you know what the circulation of newspaper and magazines depend on? Headlines. They have been perfecting the art of writing attractive headlines for over a hundred years now. The importance of headlines hasn&#8217;t just decreased yet, even in the digital world. These little creatures determine if your target audience will click and view your website or not. It is advisable that you spend as much time creating the headlines as you do on creating your web page or articles. <strong>Follow these simple rules and your headlines will appeal to the audiences as well as search engines:</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is a paradise for shoppers, sellers and advertisers. Don’t believe us? Take a look at the stats below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon.com is responsible for generating 50% of all ecommerce sale and 5% of the total US retail sale</li>
<li>More than 95 million Americans have prime membership and they spend roughly over $1.4 thousand per year</li>
<li>Amazon encounters about 2 billion visitors per month</li>
<li>According to a survey conducted by Advertiser Perceptions, Amazon is the preferred DSP platform for 41% of the advertisers</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a site solely dedicated to buying products and where shopper clearly expresses their buying intention, Amazon has access to almost accurate purchase intent data, which is unparalleled in quality and reach. It is a no-brainer as to why Amazon Advertising platform attracts massive brands and advertisers.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will learn everything about Amazon’s Demand Side Platform (DSP), what it is, the types of ad included, how it works and everything else advertisers need to know. But first we will explain in brief about Amazon Advertising structure:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1.jpg" alt="about Amazon Advertising structure" width="800" height="500" /></p>
<h2><strong>What changes took place in 2018 in Amazon Advertising?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Previously Amazon was selling its ad products through three different ad platforms – <strong><a title="Amazon Marketing Services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Marketing Services</a></strong> (AMS), Amazon Advertising Platform (AAP) and Amazon Media Group (AMG). This has now been combined in one marketplace called Amazon Advertising.</li>
<li>Amazon Advertising Platform is renamed to Amazon Demand Side Platform (DSP)</li>
<li>Headline Search Ads is renamed to Sponsored Brand Ads</li>
<li>New product targeting and bidding options were introduced in <strong><a title="Sponsored Product Ads" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sponsored Product Ads</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Is Amazon Demand Side Platform?</strong></h2>
<p>Amazon Demand Side Platform, previously known as Amazon Advertising platform, allows advertisers to programmatically reach and target relevant audience through digital display formats either on Amazon sites, across the web or in mobile sites.</p>
<p>Being a programmatic display advertising platform, DSP uses technology to better buy and manage advertiser’s video and display advertising mix. The buying process is automated, pricing is based on a dynamic pricing model and advertisers will bid on impressions in real-time to deliver the advertisement to a specific audience.</p>
<h3><strong>Amazon DSP Ads are displayed in the following forms:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Desktop Display Ads</li>
<li>Mobile Banner Ads</li>
<li>Mobile Interstitial Ads</li>
<li>Image &amp; Text Ads</li>
<li>In-stream Video Ads</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Who Can Use <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-dsp/">Amazon DSP</a>?</strong></h2>
<p>Amazon Display Advertising is available to all the brands selling on Amazon which includes manufacturers, vendors, third-party sellers as well as sellers who do not sell on Amazon and allows all of them to access to Amazon’s audience. It is great for sellers who want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create brand awareness</li>
<li>Expand customer reach beyond Advertising Console capabilities</li>
<li>Leverage Amazon audience</li>
<li>Target users based on lifestyle</li>
<li>Capture qualified traffic</li>
<li>Reach customers based on their shopping patterns and purchase history</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How to Manage DSP Ads?</strong></h2>
<p>Advertisers can choose from enterprise self-service (ESS), or Amazon managed service option.</p>
<p><strong>• Self-service:</strong><br />
Advertisers are in complete control of their campaigns and they can manage them according to their knowledge. There are no management fees.</p>
<p><strong>• Amazon Managed:</strong><br />
Advertisers choose to let Amazon to manage these ads or they handle them through ESS. ESS is Amazon’s Enterprise Self Service portal in which agencies can access Amazon’s DSP, rather than Amazon’s Internal Services Team. It typically requires a minimum ad spend of $35,000.</p>
<h5><strong>Targeting Audience:</strong></h5>
<p>Amazon DSP allows advertisers to break down customers into audience segments based on the buyer’s intention to buy a product.</p>
<p><strong>1) In-market Audiences:</strong></p>
<p>This includes audiences who are currently showing signals that they will soon make a purchase within that category. This data is based on recent searches, browses, or purchase behavior in the past 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Protein Bar</li>
<li>Baby Clothes</li>
<li>Sports Shoes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) Lifestyle Audiences:</strong></p>
<p>This reflects interest groups and includes audience who are habitual buyers of that category on a long term basis (past one year).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel lovers</li>
<li>Foodies</li>
<li>Game Of Thrones Fans</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Targeting Options:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pixel Based</strong>: Buyers who visit your brand’s website</li>
<li><strong>Product Remarketing</strong>: Retarget buyers who viewed your promoted products but did not convert</li>
<li><strong>Brand Halo Remarketing</strong>: Retarget buyers who viewed other products of your brand</li>
<li><strong>Similar Product Remarketing</strong>: Reach shoppers who are browsing product similar to yours</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Ad formats Available on DSP Platform:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>#1 Mobile Interstitial (full-screen) Ads:</strong></p>
<p>App developers can integrate full-screen advertisements inside their apps using Mobile Ads API. This type of ad is not displayed on Amazon Mobile Shopping and they feature a prominent close button and an AdChoices icon. Interstitial Ads are supported for iOS, Android and Fire smartphones and tablets. Amazon provides two types of interstitial ad templates. Both of the templates can expand to match the size of any mobile device’s screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-983" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2-1.jpg" alt="Mobile Interstitial (full-screen) Ads" width="500" height="300" /></p>

<p><strong>1) Full-Screen Image: </strong></p>
<p>As the name suggests, Full-Screen Image covers the full screen of a device and includes a single clickable image. By default, the image will be resized to display a guaranteed “safe zone.”</p>

<p>(Note: This image has been taken as a reference from Amazon)</p>
<p>In full-screen template, you are allowed to add a video in the center of the safe zone. Recommended video length is less than 15-30 seconds and it requires a 1280 x 720 pixels video thumbnail along with 2560 x 2560 background image.</p>

<p>(Note: This image has been taken as a reference from Amazon)</p>
<p><strong>Video ads can help to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create an engaging ad experience</li>
<li>Convey your brand message</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Placements on Amazon:</strong></p>
<p>These ads are live in and around Amazon product listings so the customer might encounter video ads while browsing through product listings.</p>
<h2><strong>How does Amazon Video Advertising work?</strong></h2>
<p>Video ads will automatically play as soon as they are completely visible on the screen. By default, they are muted, buyers can activate sound and even expand the ad into full-screen mode if they desire. Video ads will automatically pause once they are out of view.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tips for Amazon Video Ads:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Combine videos with other types of on-site advertising like display ads, sponsored ads and different types of ads to get best results</li>
<li>Keep video around 15 seconds or less. The ad should be very attractive in the first five seconds. This ensures that the ad is noticed even when mute</li>
<li>Video should deliver your brand message even without sound or audio</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clicking on the ad will restart the video and enable sound. So advertisers can use several call to action options including Shop Now, Learn More, See Details, Pre-order Now, Buy Tickets, Rent Now, Get a Quote</li>
<li>Advertisers can also place an optional logo image in JPG, PNG or GIF format with a minimum dimension of at least 600 x 100 pixels</li>
<li>Amazon Display Ads also allows to add a custom background image which goes behind the on-site or in-app video player. To take advantage of this feature, advertisers can use any of Amazon’s predefined templates (different for mobile, tablet and desktop placements) or purchase creative design support through Amazon media group directly.</li>
</ul>
<h5></h5>
<h5><strong>Latest DSP Interface Updates:</strong></h5>
<p>In the second week of March, Amazon rolled out the four new key updates to Amazon DSP user interface. These upgrades were based on feedback received from the participants in the program. Amazon has streamlined the operation in the below areas:</p>
<h3><strong>1) Navigation:</strong></h3>
<p>This was the most significant change made by Amazon, which changes the overall “look and feel” of the platform. According to the retail giant, navigating within the Amazon DSP will now become more intuitive and efficient. In the new layout, buttons, toggles and campaign status will now be more prominent, allowing for enhanced user experience.</p>
<h3><strong>2) Bulk Editing:</strong></h3>
<p>DSP users can now easily bulk edit the domain, audience and location targeting settings for line items. Once advertisers select the new settings, they can apply them across all lines of items selected.</p>
<h3><strong>3) Custom Reporting:</strong></h3>
<p>This feature allows DSP users to create a unique report based on their requirements. They can then save and access it within the Amazon DSP report center. Advertisers can also select the exact columns they want to include. Once the report has been created, it can be sent to the specified recipients.</p>
<h3><strong>4) Creative Moderation:</strong></h3>
<p>Amazon claims that it is working on “a number of improvements that will reduce the turnaround time for creative approval.” One of them is that they have reduced the average time it takes for the advertisers to be notified if your creative needs revision.</p>
<h2><strong>Is Amazon DSP Better Than Google &amp; Facebook?</strong></h2>
<p>Amazon DSP offerings are similar to Google and Facebook, but Amazon advertising is still in its developing phase. In fact, many of the expert advertisers state that Amazon’s advertising platform is still a few years behind Google&#8217;s PPC offerings.</p>
<p>But the potential threat of abuse of user’s private information is a big stumbling stone for both Google and Facebook. Amazon, on the other hand, has a unique opportunity as it is much lesser conflict in this matter. Plus advertisers know that Amazon’s primary business was, is and will always be selling goods, so it has a deep understanding of a user’s purchase behavior while also respecting their privacies. In the coming years, it will be exciting to see what the new changes are and which direction Amazon takes its advertising platform to, but one thing is for sure: it is expected to capture the advertising market share of Google and Facebook. The analyst at Wall Street firm S.G. Cowen projects has stated that Amazon’s ad sales could reach $24.8 billion in the upcoming five years. Now that’s a huge number and if Amazon actually reaches there, it will become the third most digital advertising giant.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As might, as it may be, even Amazon faces problems.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1.gif" alt="Amazon SFP &amp; FBA Onsite" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>Over the last few years, Amazon has become the go-to online shopping platform for millions of shoppers. But with the increase in the number of customers and sellers, Amazon had been facing issues with storing inventory at their FBA fulfillment centers. To address the overcapacity issues, Amazon has launched two programs that will encourage sellers to store inventory at their warehouses. Read on to know more about these programs.</p>
<h5><strong>Seller Fulfilled Prime – Get Prime Badge Without FBA</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Prime.jpg" alt="FBA fulfillment centers" width="656" height="164" /></p>
<p>Since its inception in 2005, Amazon Prime has made it possible for shoppers to buy unlimited products and get them at their doorsteps within just two days, with no additional expenses just a flat annual price. Soon enough shoppers learned the ease and efficiency of being an Amazon “prime” member. As a result the products with prime badge started getting lot of attention from the 100+ million prime subscribers. Not just customers, even sellers are benefited with the prime badge. Prime listings are ranked better in search results and have better chances of winning the buy box.</p>
<p>For the longest time, this privilege was available only to those sellers who have listed their products under Amazon (FBA) program. As you know, in Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) sellers send their inventory in Amazon warehouse and Amazon with its robust set up will store, pick and ship the products as well as handle the customer returns. But it’s not all roses and tide pods. These services come at a price called Amazon FBA Seller Fees.</p>
<p>In very less time, FBA became the most successful program ever launched by Amazon. However, as the merchant base grew, Amazon started facing difficulties in storing the inventory. To encourage to keep their FBA inventory moving, in the third quarter of 2018, long term storage fees were assessed monthly rather than twice a year.</p>
<p>In another effort to ease this pressure, Amazon came up with programs like Seller Fulfilled Prime and FBA Onsite. With SFP, they can get a prime badge on your listing but still can store the products at their warehouse. In simple words, SFP is the most convenient way to get the prime badge without incurring heavy FBA charges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Prime-Amazon-1.jpg" alt="Prime Amazon" width="800" height="250" /></p>
<h5><strong>Here’s How SFP Works:</strong></h5>
<p>Step 1: Seller qualify for SFP program by successfully completing the trial period<br />
Step 2: Store inventory in their own warehouse<br />
Step 3: Buy shipping labels and process orders from Amazon-approved carriers<br />
Step 4: Pick, pack and ship the order on the same day<br />
Step 5: SFP carriers will collect and deliver the product to the customer in one day</p>
<p>If everything goes well, the buyer will receive the product on time. If the order is late or damaged, then it will be handled by the seller.</p>
<h5><strong>Pros:</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>1) Avoid Split Inventory:</strong></h5>
<p>Previously sellers had to select which items will be shipped by Amazon while the remaining items would be distributed through sellers website or other online marketplaces. This decision was confusing as well as time-consuming. In the end, it would get difficult to determine which products belong to FBA. But with SFP, sellers can avoid slicing and dicing their inventory among FBA and other fulfillment channels.</p>
<h5><strong>2) Convenient Return Handling:</strong></h5>
<p>FBA sellers have encountered numerous problems when it comes to handling returns. As mentioned earlier, in SFP, returns and refunds will be managed by sellers. So they will be able to easily track and identify the items which are returned. This will reduce customer frauds to a greater extent.</p>
<h5><strong>3) Reduces Costs On Heavy And Large Items:</strong></h5>
<p>While selling heavy or large items through FBA, sellers had to incur additional shipping costs for transporting the products from their warehouse to FBA warehouses. Plus the FBA fees on such items were very high. Thanks to SFP, sellers will no longer have to pay any additional fees and they will be able to ship the products directly to the consumers. Because they are saving on the extra shipping costs, they can provide the product to the customer at a much cheaper rate.</p>
<h5><strong>4) Less Inventory To Store, Fewer Problems For Amazon:</strong></h5>
<p>Yes, this program benefits Amazon as well, or it would not have launched it in the first place. By allowing sellers to handle their shipments through their fulfillment centers, Amazon has freed itself from the cost of building new fulfillment centers. According to reports, FBA infrastructure has cost Amazon billions of dollars and with the increase in popularity of prime, it was too overwhelming for Amazon to build new centers. SFP will help Amazon alleviate the pressure to invest in their fulfillment warehouses.</p>
<h5><strong>Cons:</strong></h5>
<p>1) Requirements for inventory storage<br />
2) Investment in time and labor for picking, packing, shipping, handling and customer service<br />
3) Amazon’s strict rules for eligibility</p>
<h5><strong>How To Participate In Seller Fulfilled Prime Program?</strong></h5>
<p>Not all sellers are eligible to enroll their products in the SFP program. Like always, Amazon has set certain criteria:<br />
● Seller must have a professional account. It should be active and have a good standing<br />
● Sellers should enroll in Premium Shipping (Same Day Delivery, Two Day Shipping or both)<br />
● Sellers must agree and adhere to Amazon Return Policy<br />
● Sellers should allow Amazon to handle all the customer service inquiries<br />
● Sellers must use Amazon-approved carriers to deliver orders<br />
● On time shipment rate should be over 99%<br />
● Order cancellation rate should be less than 0.5%<br />
● Use Amazon Buy Shipping for at least 98.5% of orders</p>
<p>In order to maintain its reputation, Amazon wants its potential SFP sellers to go through a trial period for 5 to 90 day, depending on when sellers satisfy the stringent performance standards. During the trial period, the prime badge won’t be displayed on the product; still, sellers will have to deliver the product within the prescribed time period. When the seller successfully completes the trail run, they are automatically enrolled in the program and prime badge will be visible on their product.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To shorten the trial period, assign prime templates to your fastest moving SKUs so you can reach 50 orders in time.</p>
<p><strong>To remain within the SFP program sellers must:</strong><br />
● Ship items the same day<br />
● Buy shipping labels via Amazon<br />
● Consistently maintain their performance</p>
<h5><strong>Which type Of Sellers Can Use Seller Fulfilled Prime?</strong></h5>
<p>Usually, it’s the retailers who are most benefited from SFP. Retailers usually have thousands of products listed on Amazon, so they face cut-throat competition. Having a prime badge on their listing gives them an edge over their competitors and the probability of winning buy box also increases which makes a huge difference in their sales. Most of the retailers have their warehouse and shipping operation up and running. So using SFP will give them the benefits of FBM and FBA combined.</p>
<p>SFP can also benefit the brand owners who are already shipping the goods to customers themselves. Not just retailers and brand owners, SFP can be used by all the sellers who have their warehouse and shipping facilities.</p>
<h5><strong>FBA Onsite – A ‘Groundbreaking’ Program:</strong></h5>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3.gif" alt="Amazon FBA Onsite " width="480" height="347" /></p>
<p>This trial program was in beta phase in the last quarter of 2017 where it was tested with 50 hand-picked sellers. In the email invite, Amazon mentioned this program as a groundbreaking program [which] offers the best parts of Fulfillment by Amazon and Seller-Fulfilled Prime.</p>
<p>According to Amazon, FBA Onsite is a cost-effective tool that will benefit to the sellers as well as Amazon. It is a unique integration of SFP (Seller Fulfilled Prime) and FBA, where sellers will store their inventory at their warehouse and Amazon will handle the minute details that come into play with delivery. It will pick the ready-to-ship the products from the seller’s warehouse and figure out the best way for the products to reach the customers. It either uses its own logistics network or a third-party delivery service like FedEx, UPS or other independent companies. So, the hassle of choosing a delivery system falls in the able shoulders of Amazon, thus transforming your warehouse into a Fulfillment Center with efficient warehouse management software to help you manage your inventory better. Lastly, Amazon will also handle the customer service and troubleshooting if any problem arises during delivery, leaving you completely worry-free.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br />
1. Amazon’s “warehouse experts” will come and “optimize” seller’s warehouse to turn them into mini-fulfillment centers working for them<br />
2. Amazon will allow the sellers to use their proprietary warehouse software. This is provided to sellers so they can scan their inventory and print prime labels<br />
3. Amazon will handle the rest of the delivery process right from picking the products to final delivery</p>
<h5><strong>Pros:</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>1) Warehouse Optimization By Amazon Experts:</strong></h5>
<p>Amazon is pro at warehouse management. Because they want to give the best possible service to their customers, they will help you set up your warehouse for maximum efficacy. They will optimize:</p>
<p>● The methods of storing inventory<br />
● Warehouse layout and configuration<br />
● Priority of orders based on customer delivery and carrier pickups<br />
● The methods of picking and packaging the products<br />
● Onsite scanning and Amazon connection</p>
<h5><strong>2) Amazon Warehouse Management Software:</strong></h5>
<p>The experts will install warehouse management software to manage the shipping process smoothly. This software improves end to end fulfillment capabilities and enable the sellers to directly ship the products from their warehouse with a prime badge. It also includes shipping integration with Seller Central as well as automated replenishment and inventory audit capabilities.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4-1.png" alt="Amazon Warehouse Management " width="295" height="171" /></p>
<h5><strong>3) Reduced Labeling &amp; Prep Work:</strong></h5>
<p>Amazon sellers won’t have to go through the monotonous FBA workflow because they won’t be sending the products to Amazon. Sellers can hand scan and have the products online within just minutes. This can save hours of work and hundreds of dollars.</p>
<h5><strong>4) Selling Hazmat Products:</strong></h5>
<p>Hazmat products are typically blocked from sending to an FBA distribution center. With FBA onsite, sellers can ship hazmat products from their warehouse while also getting benefits like FBA. Yes, the shipping price will be high, but the fact that you will be able to sell these products is great!</p>
<h5><strong>5) Reduced Shipping Costs and FBA Fees:</strong></h5>
<p>Instead of using your or Amazon-approved shipping carriers, sellers can get direct access to Amazon’s shipping network. This can massively save seller’s money.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/12345.jpg" alt="12345" width="500" height="370" /></p>
<h5><strong>With FBA onsite, you won’t have to pay any of the below fees:</strong></h5>
<p>● FBA Inbound Shipping Fees<br />
● FBA Workflow Prep / Labeling<br />
● Order handling<br />
● Pick &amp; Pack<br />
● Weight handling<br />
● Return Fees<br />
● Short Term Inventory Storage Fees<br />
● Long-Term Inventory Storage Fees</p>
<h5><strong>Cons:</strong></h5>
<p>Not all sellers are eligible for FBA onsite as this is an invite-only program.</p>
<h5><strong>How To Be A Part Of FBA Onsite?</strong></h5>
<p>To get the benefits of this program, you will have to be personally invited by Amazon. Because of the amount of resources involved in this program, Amazon wants to keep it small. So, it is reaching out to only those sellers who are already successful.</p>
<p>The retail giant is handpicking the account based on certain metrics which are mentioned below:<br />
● Longevity of the account<br />
● Performance<br />
● Dominant category<br />
● FBA vs. FBM values</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong><br />
Amazon has cleverly solved the warehouse congestion problems by giving merchants the authority to store and ship the products themselves and also helping them manage the inventory better. This means that Amazon will get more storage space, something which Amazon has been trying to get for a while now. As for the sellers, they can enjoy low selling cost, delivery cost and can also boost their sales number with the prime badge. So, it’s a win-win situation for sellers as well as Amazon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon PPC Ads are without any doubt the most efficient way to promote your listing on Amazon. Since 2012, it has helped many sellers boost their product visibility and traffic on the detail page. If executed the right way, you too can skyrocket your conversion rates and sales. We have outlined all the basic information as well as the pro tips that can help you juice profits from your private label products on FBA.</p>
<h5><strong>Here’s a quick walkthrough of what we have covered in this article:</strong></h5>
<p>● Types of PPC Ads And Eligibility Criteria<br />
● How Does Amazon PPC Work?<br />
● Common PPC Terminologies<br />
● Factors Affecting PPC Ad Placement<br />
● Preparation To Make Before Starting PPC Campaigns<br />
● How To Calculate Your Ideal ACOS?<br />

<h5><strong>PPC Ad Types &amp; Its Eligibility Criteria:</strong></h5>
<p>PPC Ads can be classified into two types:</p>
<h5><strong>1) Sponsored Product Ads (Available to Sellers &amp; Vendors):</strong></h5>
<p>This keyword-based ad type is typically displayed amongst organic search results. They work best when you have done your homework with keyword research. The only eligibility criteria required is the buy box. If you have a buy box, you can start making the campaigns right away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1.png" alt="Sponsored Product Ads " width="833" height="624" /></p>
<p>There are various types of campaigns in Sponsored Product Ads:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2.png" alt=" Sponsored Product Ads:" width="852" height="530" /></p>
<p><strong>• Automatic Campaign:</strong> Here Amazon does all the work. All sellers have to do is enter a campaign name, select a product, add start date and the budget. Amazon will browse through your product title, bullet points, description and backend search terms to find relevant keywords. Automatic campaigns are an excellent way to start PPC ads and to discover new long tail keywords.</p>
<p><strong>• Manual Campaign:</strong> In manual campaigns, sellers can have more control over the working of the campaign. To get started with manual campaigns, select a product, add your keywords or target a product, set bids and allocate a budget. Sellers can fine-tune their campaign settings to target keywords, categories or individual products.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3.png" alt="Manual Campaign:" width="795" height="226" /></p>
<p><strong>o Keyword targeting:</strong> You can add all the keywords for which you want your product to be displayed.<br />
<strong>o Product Display Ads A.K.A Product Targeting:</strong> They are designed to be a self-service option where sellers can choose the ASIN they want their ad to be displayed on. Advertisers can target product detail pages, categories, complimentary listing and related interests:</p>
<p><strong>1) Category:</strong> You choose a category as a whole. Amazon will display your ad on the products that match with your chosen category. Category targeting is a great way to boost visibility and build brand awareness, especially while launching a new product. However, as your ad will be eligible for a broad reach, your ACOS will be high and conversion low, unless you have a very desirable product.</p>
<p><strong>2) Individual Product:</strong> You can target a competitor’s ASINs that are similar to your products as well as other products from your catalog. This much narrow and quite mature compared to former because here you can choose a product. So there are more chances of winning a sale.<br />
Tip: Do not target any product that has more reviews or low price than your product.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4.png" alt="Product PPC" width="801" height="735" /></p>
<h5><strong>2) Sponsored Brands (Available to Sellers &amp; Vendors):</strong></h5>
<p>Previously known as Headline Search Ads, Sponsored Brand Ads are keyword driven PPC ads that stretch across the top of the product detail page because of which they are more visible than any other paid advertisements. They have vast possibilities for customization. Sellers can add a small tagline and target minimum three or more than three products. The landing page of this ad can be your product detail page or brand page (storefront). The eligibility criteria required for Sponsored Brands is Brand Registry 2.0.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5.jpg" alt="Sponsored Brands " width="800" height="800" /></p>
<h5><strong>How Does Amazon PPC Work?</strong></h5>
<p>People don’t visit Amazon to window shop; they are more than willing to make a purchase. So it is apparent that it gets millions of serious searches every day. When they type a search query, Amazon will fetch hundreds of product. Obviously, not all the results are organic, some of the sellers are “paying” to get amongst the organic results and sometimes even above the organic results. They are called sponsored ads or paid results.</p>
<p>The concept of Amazon sponsored product ads is pretty simple and quite similar to Google’s advertisement system. It is based on keywords and auctions. The seller bids a certain amount on a keyword for which they want their ad to be displayed. The one who has bid the highest amount will be on the top of the search results; the second highest position will appear in the second position and so on. As the name suggests, sellers will pay only when a customer clicks on their ad.</p>
<h5><strong>Common PPC Terminologies Sellers Should Know:</strong></h5>
<p><strong>• ACOS:</strong> ACOS stands for an average cost of sales. It is the percentage of how much you spend on ads in comparison with total advertised sales achieved. For example, if your total spend was $4 and it resulted in $20 attributed sales then ACOS would be 20%.</p>
<p><strong>• Keyword Bid:</strong> Maximum cost you are willing to pay when someone clicks on your ad. Manual campaigns allow you to change the bid on every keyword. While in an automatic campaign you will have to specify the bid for the whole ad group. The default bid will be the cost-per-click for every ad from the ad group.</p>
<p><strong>• Adjust Bids By Placement:</strong> Amazon allows advertisers to set placement bid adjustment for top of search page and product page placements. Bid adjustment can range up to zero to 900%.</p>
<p><strong>•Impressions:</strong> It stands for the number of times your ad was displayed when a customer enters a search query that matches the keyword you have added in the campaign. Sellers will have to just pay for a click; there is no cost for impressions.</p>
<p><strong>•Clicks:</strong> The number of times shoppers have clicked on your ad to view the complete detail page.</p>
<p><strong>• CTR:</strong> Expanded as Click-through Rate, it is the ratio of impressions versus the clicks. In simple words, it determines the number of times your advertisement was clicked by a shopper when your ad was displayed.</p>
<p><strong>•CPC:</strong> CPC or Cost-per-click means the average amount you paid for each click on an ad.</p>
<p><strong>•Conversion Rates:</strong> The percentage of sales you get in comparison to the number of clicks. So it means the number of shoppers who visited your product detail page versus the number of shoppers who actually purchased your product.</p>
<p><strong>• Budget:</strong> Amount of dollars you are willing to spend on a campaign. This amount will be the maximum amount you are willing to spend, not the amount you will actually spend on your campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>• Dynamic Bidding:</strong> Sellers can choose from any of the below three options while setting a bid:</p>
<p><strong>o Dynamic Bids – Down Only:</strong> Amazon will automatically reduce the bid if the search query entered by the customer is not very relevant or not likely to perform well.</p>
<p><strong>o Dynamic Bids – Up &amp; Down:</strong> Amazon will automatically increase or decrease the bid on the basis of convertibility.</p>
<p><strong>o Fixed Bids:</strong> Amazon will use the exact click price for any click opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>• Keyword Match Type:</strong></p>
<p><strong>o Broad:</strong> Your ad will be reflected when a shopper searches for your keyword in any order. This is the least restrictive match type as it matches to a larger number of search terms and reaches a large audience.</p>
<p><strong>o Phrase:</strong> Your ad will be reflected when a shopper searches for exact search terms in the same order.</p>
<p><strong>o Exact:</strong> Your ad will be reflected when a customer searches for the exact keyword without any word repeating in the search query.</p>

<h5><strong>Factors Affecting PPC Ad Placement:</strong></h5>
<p>Your ad will compete with hundreds of other ads. Amazon will decide the relevancy of ads on the below-mentioned metrics:</p>
<p><strong>• Bid:</strong> The higher you bid, the more are the possibilities of your ad being displayed on the top of the first page.<br />
<strong>• Quality Factor:</strong> Ad quality also plays a key role here. The higher quality of ad you have the lesser you set a bid. Amazon mostly takes ad’s click history into account.</p>
<h5><strong>Before starting PPC campaigns, make sure your product has:</strong></h5>
<p>• Buy box<br />
• Competitive price<br />
• Accurate product descriptions<br />
• Plenty of images<br />
• Good reviews</p>
<p>Just think of your product description page as a landing page for your brand. You want to make sure it is very informative and at the same time attractive. So don’t forget to optimize it properly before you start to bring traffic to it.</p>
<h5><strong>How To Calculate Your Ideal ACOS?</strong></h5>
<p>You will need the following data:<br />
• Selling price: $30<br />
• Cost of goods sold (COGS): $5<br />
• All FBA fees: $12<br />
• Miscellaneous costs: $4</p>
<p>To calculate your ideal ACOS, subtract COGS, FBA fees and miscellaneous costs from selling price.</p>
<p>$30 – ($5 + $12 + $4) = $9<br />
So, you can spend up to $9 to advertise. You can calculate your ACOS threshold by dividing the total income from the selling price.</p>
<p>$9 / $30 = $0.30</p>
<p>Your ideal ACOS threshold for your PPC campaign is 30%.</p>
<h5><strong>Types Of Campaigns Sellers Should Have – Suggested By Our PPC Expert:</strong></h5>
<p>Now that you know the basics of PPC, it is time to start making campaigns. Apart from the normal product and category related campaigns, there are a few other campaign sellers should make:</p>
<p><strong>• ACOS Scraping Campaign:</strong><br />
There are some keywords whose ACOS is very high, but we cannot remove them from the campaign because they are root keywords. What happens is that because of those keywords other keywords do not get impressions and clicks. Sellers can create a separate campaign from those keywords.</p>
<p><strong>• Keyword Ranking Campaign:</strong><br />
Sometimes your product does not rank on the root keyword. For that, sellers can create a campaign containing only the root keyword. Increase the bid for those keywords. As they will get more impression, clicks and sale, their organic ranking will automatically increase.</p>
<p><strong>• Zero Impression Campaign:</strong><br />
Here you can add all the keywords which are just sitting there in your campaign without any impressions or clicks. Create a separate campaign for those keywords, increase their bid and monitor the performance for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>• Holiday Special Keyword Campaign:</strong><br />
Create a separate campaign for every upcoming holiday like Christmas, Easter, Prime Day, Memorial Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day and many more. Along with your normal keywords, add festival related keywords example: Christmas gift for her. Conduct thorough keyword research for the same. We have listed out the holidays on which you can make individual campaigns:</p>
<p>o Easter<br />
o Mother’s Day<br />
o Memorial Day<br />
o Father’s Day<br />
o Independence Day<br />
o Labor Day<br />
o Columbus Day<br />
o Black Friday<br />
o Cyber Monday<br />
o Prime Day<br />
o Christmas</p>
<h5><strong>Campaigns Have Been Created, Now What?</strong></h5>
<p>PPC is a living organism. It is not a set-it-and-forget-it sort of thing. You will have to monitor it daily and make changes. What works today might not work tomorrow, so you will have to implement new strategies daily. Your goal should be to spend under the budget to maintain the ACOS while increasing sales.</p>
<p>Campaigns can be optimized manually or via bulk upload. Bulk upload allows you to quickly and efficiently optimize hundreds of campaigns and ad groups at once. You can set filters to identify the non-performing SKUs, keywords and search terms. Bulk upload also makes it easier to change keyword bids, add new keywords or negative keywords. After you have optimized your ad groups and campaigns with bulk upload, you can move to individual optimization.</p>
<h5><strong>Consider Below Things While Amazon PPC Management:</strong></h5>
<p>• Impression<br />
• Clicks<br />
• Spend<br />
• Sales<br />
• ACOS<br />
• CPC<br />
• Average Suggested Bid</p>

<h5><strong>Things to keep in mind:</strong></h5>
<p>• Keep monitoring whether your ad is delivering or not<br />
• <strong><a title="Amazon Sponsored Products Optimization" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Sponsored Products Optimization</a></strong> is a continuous process so keep a check on your campaigns daily or it will result in huge spends.<br />
• Constantly monitor your performance after scaling the bids<br />
• Do not add ASIN as your keyword<br />
• Don’t just rely on sponsored product ads, if you are a vendor or have a brand registry, you should try for Sponsored Brands or Product Display Ad because they will have less competition.<br />
• Always keep trying new strategies &#8211; look out for opportunities, however small and try to leverage that in your PPC strategies<br />
• Add converting search terms from search term report<br />
• Pause non converting keywords<br />
• Add negative keywords (negative phrase and negative exact) at campaign and ad group level<br />
• Adjust bid by date range<br />
• Don’t wait, be aggressive!</p>

A: You can add up to 1000 keywords in an ad group. You should add as many relevant keywords as you can because it will help Amazon better identify your product.</p>
<p>Q: Can we add brand keywords?<br />
A: You can add yours and competitor’s brand keywords in your campaign, but it is not recommended. This is because customers who search on Amazon know what they want and if they are typing Nike Sports Shoes in the search bar, they won’t buy from any other brand even if your product appears on the top.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a delay in Amazon Ad reporting?<br />
A: A lot of Amazon sellers get frustrated and make changes in a bid when they do not see the results right away. But the whole data is reflected after two days.</p>
<p>Q: Should you use Amazon’s suggested bid and keywords?<br />
A: Amazon’s suggested bid is based on your conversion rates and overall bids set by other advertisers. You can consider Amazon’s suggested bid and even make a campaign which contains Amazon’s suggested keywords and monitor how it performs.</p>
<p>Q: How to name the campaign?<br />
A: Stick to a consistent naming pattern and follow it on all of your campaigns. This will help you stay organized. Make sure it is simple and easy to remember.</p>
<p>Q: Does Amazon PPC influence organic ranking?<br />
Yes. PPC can positively affect the organic ranking of your product. As the sale of your product will increase, Amazon will place it higher in the search results.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It won’t be an exaggeration to say that mobile is not the future of ecommerce, it is the present. According to research released by the CTA, almost two-third of US customers use mobile to shop. In the Amazon marketplace, the number is most likely to go higher. During the holiday season, 70% of the customers shop via mobile devices. So the bottom line is that optimizing the mobile experience should be the number one priority for every Amazon seller. What usually happens is that brands look at the listing on their desktop and forget that mobile shopping is poles apart from desktop shopping.</p>
<h5><strong>How Will Your Listing Look On Mobile vs Desktop?</strong></h5>
<p><strong>In the mobile version, the placement and look of the four key parts of your listing will change:</strong><br />
● Product title<br />
● Bullet points<br />
● Product description<br />
● Product images</p>
<p><strong>Below, we have listed out the significant changes that will take place in your product detail page:</strong><br />
● User will be able to see the images first and then the text<br />
● Only the first 80 characters of the title will be visible<br />
● The sponsored tag is less noticeable than the desktop version, so it will be hard to differentiate sponsored and organic results<br />
● The description will show above bullet points<br />
● Only three bullet points will be visible at first after that buyer will have to click at the “&gt;” icon<br />
● Only the first 200 characters of description are shown, to read the rest buyer will have to click at the “&gt;” icon<br />
● Just after the images, similar product offers will be shown on Amazon</p>
<h5><strong>How to Optimize For Mobile?</strong></h5>
<h5><strong>Step #1 Tune Your Product Title:</strong></h5>
<p>This is the first textual information buyer will read. On mobile apps, only the first 80 characters of the title would show up. So it is critical that you add high-frequency keywords as well as a standout feature in the first part. This will make your title different in the search result and increase the Click Through Rate (CTR). While using descriptive terms, carefully consider which one to prioritize, so buyers do not miss any important information while scrolling down. Just by glancing once, the buyer should be able to identify what is the product and why is it good. If the brand name is not famous, it is better to add it at last. You cannot ignore the fact that “by ABC” is mentioned right under the shortened title, so it’s better not to waste your precious characters in writing the brand name first.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1-2.jpg" alt="1" width="800" height="800" /></p>
<p><strong>This is how your title should be:</strong><br />
Main Keyword (Pack of or dimensions, quantity or other important information) + One Unique Benefit That Differentiates Your Product from Competitors + Synonym Keywords + Other Benefits + Brand Name</p>
<p><strong>General guidelines:</strong><br />
● Capitalize the first letter of each word (except conjunctions)<br />
● Avoid all caps and symbols such as exclamation mark or dollar sign<br />
● Stay away from promotional words like “on sale”, “bestseller” or “free shipping”<br />
● Important information like packaging and quantity should be at the front<br />
● Spell out the measurements. E.g., 6 inches instead of 6”<br />
● Make the title readable. If the title feels unnatural while reading, the customer will scroll down right away<br />
● Use commas and dash to break up sentences</p>
<h5><strong>Step #2 Optimize Your Hero Image:</strong></h5>
<p>Just like the desktop version, images are the first thing buyers will see in your listing. But unlike desktop, buyers will be able to see only the hero image; as thumbnails are not visible, they will have to scroll through to view other images. The first impression counts so make sure you have an amazing main image which captures buyer’s attention. As the default orientation of mobile phones is a portrait, the mobile apps will favor images with longer proportions than those with wider proportions. Plus in mobiles, the images will appear much smaller compared to the desktop, so it is essential to have high definition images that are not pixelated.</p>
<p>Only the first 7 images will be displayed on the product page, no matter how many a seller uploads. While a customer can open and view all 9 images in desktop, there is no possibility to view the last two images on mobile. So set the order of your image accordingly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-2-1.jpg" alt="2-2" width="800" height="800" /></p>
<p><strong>General guidelines:</strong><br />
● Images should 1000 x 1000 pixels for zooming capability<br />
● Product should fill 80% of the image<br />
● Highlight the benefits and features through infographics<br />
● Keep the satisfaction guaranteed image in the last</p>

<h5><strong>Step #3 Capitalize On The First Three Bullet Points:</strong></h5>
<p>List the copy with concise bullet points that focus on the product’s benefits for users rather than just listing out the complicated features and heavy technical information. For example, writing EASY TO CLEAN will be more appropriate rather than writing DISHWASHER SAFE. Capitalize words at the beginning of each bullet point so the user can easily identify the key selling points, the rest of the part is for A9. Avoid duplicating the text in your description and bullet points section. Bullet points should be no longer than 200 characters; otherwise, they will look too hard to read and bulky. Make sure that any copy you include adds value to your listing.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3-2-1.jpg" alt="3-2" width="800" height="800" /></p>
<p><strong>General guidelines:</strong><br />
● Make the headers of each bullet point capital<br />
● Put the most important points first<br />
● Focus on benefits and not features<br />
● Focus on resolving the pain points<br />
● Language should be brief, punchy and hard hitting<br />
● Include a call to action in the 3rd bullet point</p>
<h5><strong>Step #4 Cut The Fluff From The Description:</strong></h5>
<p>You have already described the features in the bullet points, so reserve this section for storytelling about the product and brand as well as to explain to the users what sets your product apart from others in its category. To make the description skimmable and easy to follow, break up the lengthy paragraphs with space. Only the first 200 characters of the description will reflect. Include the most compelling information first so the user will click to see the rest. Another important thing sellers must take note of is that all the information of the description will be crammed into one paragraph. Buyers won’t be able to see the formatting unless and until they actually click and expand the description field.</p>
<p><strong>General guidelines:</strong><br />
● Focus on the first 200 characters<br />
● Too long paragraphs will turn off the buyer’s interest. So break the paragraphs into small readable sections<br />
● Language should be conversational. Example: Tired of cleaning the grill grates with flimsy plastic brushes? Make cleanup hassle-free, convenient and quick with OXB BBQ Grill Brush!<br />
● Use bold formatting to highlight the key aspects<br />
● Prioritize the description layout wisely</p>
<h5><strong>Step #5 Make The Most of Video Shorts:</strong></h5>
<p>If a seller has uploaded a video on their product listing, then it will be hidden among other product images. The hope is that the customer will swipe left through the images and get through the end to view the video.</p>
<p>One plus point is Amazon Video Shorts: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Video-Shorts/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9013971011" rel="nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Video-Shorts/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9013971011</a>. They appear right below the product description and features. Adding video is becoming more and more popular day by day and brands should think about a video dedicated to explain the features of their product.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/4-2-1.jpg" alt="4-2" width="800" height="800" /></p>
<h5><strong>Step #6 Implement Digestible Enhanced Brand Content</strong></h5>
<p>Available to all sellers who have Amazon Brand Registry, <a title="Enhanced Brand Content" href="https://www.amazonebcservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhanced Brand Content</a> is a great converting tool that will enhance the look of your product detail page and answer the most commonly asked customer questions. The good news is that EBC is displayed exceptionally well on mobile. Shoppers will not have to click through like description and features to view EBC. By implementing EBC in your product detail page, shoppers can see everything from title, description and enticing graphics without having to click through.</p>
<p><strong>General guidelines:</strong><br />
● Don’t go too heavy on the text as it will be difficult to view on mobile<br />
● Make clean and neat images that are effective<br />
● Use Amazon modules to make the EBC more readable, scannable and user-friendly</p>
<h5><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></h5>
<p>If done right, mobile optimization can be a key advantage that can give you an edge over your competitors. Besides, mobile experience won’t go anywhere; it will just get bigger day by day. Strive for a clear, crisp and to the point copy and remove anything that does not convey your product features, brand message and keywords.
