										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Launched in 2019, Sponsored Display Ads are the newest type of advertising that’s been growing in popularity since its launch. According to Jungle Scout, in 2021, about 25% of the third-party sellers use Sponsored Display Ads and it accounts for 2% of Amazon’s advertising revenue.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’ve detailed what Sponsored Display Ads are, how they work, how to set them up, why they are important, and what has changed.</p>
<h2>What are Sponsored Display Ads?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78508 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1.png" alt="Amazon Sponsored Display Ads Agency" width="1339" height="506" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1.png 1339w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-300x113.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-1024x387.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-768x290.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-500x189.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-800x302.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-1280x484.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-600x227.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1339px) 100vw, 1339px" /></p>
<p>Sponsored Display Ads, formerly known as Amazon Product Display Ads, allow brand registered sellers to show their ads to shoppers who have previously viewed your products or similar products, purchased from you, or used a search term relevant to your product.</p>
<h2>Eligibility criteria for Sponsored Display Ads</h2>
<p>Sponsored Display Ads are available to vendors and professional sellers registered in the Amazon Brand Registry.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> &#8211; The audience: interest targeting option is currently available to vendors only.</p>

<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78510 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3.jpg" alt="Where do Sponsored Display Ads appear?" width="1295" height="668" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3.jpg 1295w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-1024x528.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-768x396.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-500x258.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-800x413.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-1280x660.jpg 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-600x309.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1295px) 100vw, 1295px" /></h2>
<ul>
<li>Product detail pages right below the bullet points or the buy box</li>
<li>Customer review pages</li>
<li>Top of the offer listing pages</li>
<li>Off Amazon</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Amazon, about 64% of shoppers use more than one retail channel to make a purchase. With Sponsored Display Ads, you can advertise in front of shoppers even when they’ve navigated away from the Amazon website. They appear outside of Amazon on websites owned by or partnered with Amazon.</p>
<h2>How are Sponsored Display Ads &amp; Amazon DSP Ads different?</h2>
<p><a title="Amazon DSP" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-dsp/">Amazon DSP</a> Ads and Sponsored Display ads have a lot in common, like the ability to remarket and to advertise on off-Amazon platforms, but they do have a long list of differences:</p>
<style type="text/css">

<h2>How do Sponsored Display Ads work?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78511 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4.png" alt="How do Amazon Sponsored Display Ads work?" width="997" height="244" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4.png 997w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4-300x73.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4-768x188.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4-500x122.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4-800x196.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4-600x147.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px" /><br />
Just like Sponsored Products Ads and Sponsored Brand Ads, Sponsored Display Ads are pay-per-click, self-service ads where you set a budget and bid against other sellers for placement. However, unlike Sponsored Products Ads and Sponsored Brand Ads, Sponsored Display Ads targets shoppers based on audience interests and shopping behaviours as well as their page view history.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.estorefactory.co.uk/amazon-sponsored-ads/">Sponsored Display Ads</a> include two types of targeting options: product targeting &amp; audiences.</p>
<h3>1) Product targeting</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78512 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5.png" alt="Display ads for Amazon" width="1137" height="417" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5.png 1137w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-300x110.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-1024x376.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-768x282.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-500x183.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-800x293.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-600x220.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1137px) 100vw, 1137px" /></p>
<p>Product targeting allows you to reach shoppers who are browsing related products and categories. Advertisers can also display their ads on product pages of top competitors to lure customers to their detail page. If your competitor’s listing receives a lot of traffic, you can offer a discount or lower your prices slightly to entice customers to choose your product over competing products. Advertisers can also use product targeting to sell complementary products. For example, if you sell iPhone 12 phone case, you can target shoppers who are buying iPhone 12.</p>
<p>Ads appear on the Amazon home page, product detail pages, or shopping results pages.</p>
<h3>2) Audiences</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78513 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6.png" alt="Amazon products display ads" width="1007" height="752" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6.png 1007w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6-300x224.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6-768x574.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6-500x373.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6-800x597.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6-600x448.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px" /><br />
Sponsored Display audiences is divided into two subcategories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Views remarketing<br />
</strong>It allows you to target shoppers based on the products they have viewed. Amazon suggests using views remarketing if you want to remarket to high intent audiences. Your ads will show in front of shoppers who have viewed detail pages of your product or similar products in the past 30 days but have not purchased. Ads appear on the Amazon home page, product detail pages, shopping results pages and on third-party websites and apps.</li>
<li><strong>Interests (Available for vendors only)</strong><br />
It allows you to target shoppers based on their past shopping behavior. This unique targeting option is for advertisers looking to increase their brand awareness and recall to new shoppers whose shopping behavior suggests that they might be interested in your products. Ads appear on the Amazon home page, product detail pages, or shopping results pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sponsored Display Ad campaigns are retail aware, meaning they automatically pause if your products are out of stock. Amazon will automatically exclude shoppers who have purchased the product you are advertising.</p>
<h2>What is the cost of running Sponsored Display Ad campaigns?</h2>
<p>Sponsored Display Ads are <a title="Pay Per Click Ads" href="https://www.estorefactory.com.au/amazon-sponsored-ads/">pay-per-click ads</a>, so you pay only when a customer clicks on your ad. The cost per click is determined in an auction where each advertiser sets a bid (maximum amount they are willing to pay per click) and the highest bidder wins. However, the highest bidder does not necessarily pay for the amount they bid; they only pay $0.01 more than the second-highest bid.</p>
<p><strong>What percentage of my total advertising budget should be allocated to Sponsored Display Ads?</strong><br />
Unlike DSP ads, there is no minimum ad spend required for Sponsored Display Ads and advertisers can also set a daily budget to control their ad spend. Set aside around 5-15% of your total advertising budget for Sponsored Display Ads.</p>
<h2>How to set up Sponsored Display Ad campaigns?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Setting up Sponsored Display Ads is simple. In just a few clicks, you can have your display ad campaigns up and running. The steps are very similar to setting up your Sponsored Product campaign.</li>
<li>Go to the “Advertising” tab and click on “Campaign Manager.”</li>
<li>Hit the “Create Campaign” button and click on “Sponsored Display” under “Choose your campaign type.”</li>
<li>Enter your campaign name, date range, daily budget and ad group name. We recommend you start with a $20 daily budget. As your campaign performs, you can increase the budget.</li>
<li>Choose between “Audiences” and “Product Targeting.”</li>
<li>Next, choose the product you want to advertise. You can advertise up to 10,000 ASINs per campaign.</li>
<li>Set a bid. Amazon automatically suggests a default bid, but you can bid any amount you like.</li>
<li>You have the option to customize your ad creative or have Amazon set it for you. You can add your logo and a catchy headline.</li>
<li>Finally, choose where you want your ads to show. Amazon will also show you a preview for better understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is recommended to have a Sponsored Product Ad campaign set up before you begin with Sponsored Brand Ad campaigns. You can transform your high-performing, high-converting ASINs.</p>
<h2>Are Sponsored Display Ads right for me?</h2>
<p>It totally depends on you. However, according to Amazon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisers who use Sponsored Display Ads see up to 82% of their sales driven by new-to-brand customers.</li>
<li>On average, campaigns using Amazon’s product targeting recommendations saw 2x more impressions and 1.5x more clicks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask us, Sponsored Display Ads bring exciting opportunities for sellers and vendors, including remarketing your product to shoppers and advertising your products on third-party websites. According to Amazon, only 4% of the browsers convert to shoppers immediately. An average shopper will take about 6-7 days to go from browsers to shoppers. With Sponsored Display Ads remarketing, you can re-engage shoppers who have viewed your detail page or a similar detail page and keep your products on top of their minds.</p>
<p>Your ads will get some of the best real-estate on Amazon: product detail pages. Sponsored Display Ads, when used in tandem with Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brand Ads, can have a compounding effect on your impressions and brand awareness. They also allow you to cross-sell your own products and target competing products.</p>
<p>As these ads are not displayed anywhere on the SERPs, they are less competitive than Sponsored Product and Sponsored Brand ads, so your ACOS and CPC are going to be lower.</p>
<p><strong>With Sponsored Display Ads, advertisers can:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Retarget customers who have visited your product detail page in the past 30 days</li>
<li>Target similar products and categories</li>
<li>Target shoppers, based on their past shopping behavior</li>
<li>Target shoppers based on their interests</li>
<li>Generate awareness for newly-launched products</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sponsored Display Ads best practices</h2>
<h3>#1: Don’t set it and forget it</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to keep your Sponsored Display Ad cost under control is by regular bid optimization. If ACOS is greater than our target ACOS, increase your bids. If ACOS is less than your target ACOS, decrease the target bid. Monitor your bids frequently so you can reduce irrelevant spend and make the most of available opportunities.</p>
<p>Pro tip: If you find yourself too busy to micromanage PPC campaigns, consider hiring an <a title="Amazon Marketing Consultant" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/">Amazon marketing consultant</a>.</p>
<h3>#2: Identify new targeting opportunities</h3>
<p>If you have Sponsored Display Ad campaigns running, use the data to identify new targeting opportunities. Here are some of the ways to identify and find new ASINs you can target in your display ad campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through the ‘Products related to this item’ section on your product detail page.
<ul>
<li>Check out the ‘Frequently bought together’ to target complementary products.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look out for new competitors in your category.</li>
</ul>
<p>While you should always be on the lookout for new ASINs for targeting, don’t forget to weed out the ASINs that simply aren’t performing. Go with what works, and remove what doesn’t.</p>
<h3>#3: Keep on updating the products you advertise</h3>
<p>Just like you retire any target ASINs that are not working, it is essential that you continually update the products you are advertising. The products you advertise must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profitable ACOS</li>
<li>High sales volume</li>
<li>Optimized copy and images</li>
<li>15+ positive reviews</li>
</ul>
<h3>#4: Leverage negative targeting</h3>
<p>Negative targeting is available for campaigns that use the product targeting option. Use negative targeting to remove brands you do not want your ads to target. To add negative targeting, go to a campaign that is using the product targeting option and click on an ad group. You will find a tab named “Negative Targeting” on the left side of the browser. Click on the tab and add your negative target. Please note that negative targets can be added only after a campaign is created.</p>
<h3>#5: Set your campaign goals first</h3>
<p>If you are looking to maximize your CTR, consider adding our best-selling products and target against your competitive products. To ensure better conversion, target competitors with fewer reviews, lower ratings, or higher prices. Advertisers also use Sponsored Display Ads to promote their seasonal or holiday-specific products. The ads are now enabled with deals and savings badges so shoppers won’t miss a deal.</p>
<p>Sponsored Display Ad campaigns can also be used to promote newly launched products. Target your already-established, best selling and popular products. You can leverage the traffic they receive on their detail page and create awareness for your just-launched products.</p>
<h3>#6 Don’t skimp on ad creative</h3>
<p>Amazon automatically populates the ad creative based on your product details, so your product detail page should be properly optimized, complete with a detailed copy and high-resolution images. Prime eligibility, coupon and deals badge are automatically visible on your ad. Advertisers also have the option to add a custom headline to make the ad more compelling. Use phrases like “new” and call to action like “Buy Now” to trigger a response from the customers. Avoid making any unsupported claims like “Best Seller” or “#1” as they won’t be approved by Amazon.</p>
<p>To make sure your product detail page is retail ready, hire our <a title="Amazon Listing Optimization Services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/">Amazon listing optimization services</a>.</p>
<h3>#7 Don’t quit midway</h3>
<p>If you are running a Sponsored Display Ad campaign for the first time, don’t pause them in just a few weeks, just because you didn’t see desired results. Amazon suggests running display ad campaigns for at least 90 days. This also gives you more time to experiment and optimize.</p>
<h2>Sponsored Display Ads 2022 Updates</h2>
<h3>#1: Portfolio</h3>
<p>Portfolio lets you group and organize campaigns into collections that mirror the structure of their business with portfolios. With a portfolio, advertisers will also get advanced budget controls. When your portfolio budget is exhausted, all campaigns within the portfolio will automatically pause until you increase the budget and reactivate them.</p>
<h3>#2: Marketplace availability</h3>
<p><a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/sponsored-display?tag=googhydr-20&amp;hvadid=456667949660&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=7174539134604122031&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=b&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9061744&amp;hvtargid=kwd-897365280403&amp;ref=pd_sl_3gfskzn4rh_b_sspa_ggl_d_in_ct_456667949660" rel="nofollow">Sponsored Display Ad</a> product targeting and audience is now available in the Netherlands, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Brazil.</p>
<h3>#3: Use bulksheets to efficiently launch new campaigns</h3>
<p>Advertisers can use bulksheets to create and optimize sponsored ads campaigns at scale. You can also find performance metrics, including cost per click (CPC), return on ad spend (ROAS), and conversion rate, to help you analyze campaign performance at the keyword level. Bulk sheets save time and minimize manual effort by letting you create and manage campaigns in bulk, create multiple ad groups and manage thousands of keywords all at once.</p>
<h3>#4: Improved product and targeting recommendations</h3>
<p>When submitting a list of products, advertisers will now get improved product and category recommendations from Amazon. These recommendations are ranked by their profitability of helping to increase the click-through rate of your selected advertised products. According to Amazon, advertisers who use recommendations see 17% higher impressions and 2X the number of clicks for those targets, compared to those not using recommendations.</p>
<h2>That’s all for today</h2>
<p>Sponsored Display Ads are a truly unique ad type because they let you retarget your shoppers and allow you to reach audiences off Amazon. When used well, it will help you increase brand awareness and recall both on and off Amazon. If you are a brand registered seller or a vendor to Amazon, including Sponsored Display Ads in your advertising arsenal is a no-brainer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 90% of the Amazon sellers we work with create PPC campaigns without setting a goal first. You cannot throw in a bunch of keywords, set bids and hope for the campaigns to work. The keywords you add, the bids you set, the budget you allot – everything depends on your campaign objective. Whether or not a campaign is successful is also highly subjective. If your goal is brand awareness, you might not be bothered by the increased ACOS; all you care about is the visibility and reach of your campaigns. This quick guide provides you with an overview of the types of <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon Sponsored Ad</a> campaigns you can create based on your objective. Let’s get started.</p>
<h2>#1: Research campaign</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-77960 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.jpg" alt="Research campaign" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>These campaigns work great to uncover new keywords and search terms shoppers are using to find your product. These campaigns help you stay up-to-date with the latest in trend keywords as Amazon’s algorithm and buying behavior evolves. Your research campaign should typically be an automatic campaign so you can download search term keywords every week and get your hands on profitable keywords that Amazon thinks perform well for you.</p>
<h2>#2: Money making campaign</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-77961 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.jpg" alt="Money making campaign" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /><br />
As the name suggests, these campaigns will be your most profitable campaigns as they’ll house your top-performing products and their top converting keywords. Investing in these types of campaigns can help you increase your organic ranking for a specific keyword.</p>
<h2>#3: Competitor targeting campaign</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-77962 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3.jpg" alt="Competitor targeting campaign" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /><br />
These campaigns should include keywords that contain your competitor’s brand name. For example, if you are selling Nike shoes, the keywords you should target are “Adidas shoes,” “Reebok shoes,” etc. Make sure the product you’re selling is priced lower than your competitors to give customers a reason to choose you over your competitors.</p>
<h2>#4: Brand protection campaign</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-77963 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4.jpg" alt="Brand protection campaign" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /><br />
These campaigns are set up to protect your market share and refrain anyone from making a sale using your brand name. Advertisers can build brand protection campaigns after they see momentum in sales and an increase in organic ranking. Brand protection campaigns will include all the products from your brand and all the keywords that contain your brand name.</p>
<h2>#5: Protective targeting campaign</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-77959 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5.jpg" alt="Protective targeting campaign" width="1140" height="517" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-300x136.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-1024x464.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-768x348.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-500x227.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-800x363.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-600x272.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /><br />
These are your typical product targeting campaigns, but you leverage them to target your own ASINs. This keeps your competitors from stealing shoppers off your listing. Using these campaigns, you can make the most of the real estate available on the product detail page and even give shoppers a chance to view another product from your catalog.</p>
<h2>#6: Seasonal push campaign</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-77964 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6.jpg" alt="Seasonal push campaign" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /><br />
Create and launch these campaigns to promote seasonal products. Run these campaigns prior to the festival/holiday to target shoppers when they are in a seasonal buying mode. Sponsored Brand ad campaigns work best because you can use an image and custom tagline to lure the shoppers in. Use seasonal push campaigns prior to Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Halloween, Back to school and other holidays. Seasonal campaigns can also be used to sell out the remaining stock of seasonal products.</p>
<h2>#7: Product launch campaign</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-77965 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7.jpg" alt="Product launch campaign" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /><br />
PPC plays a crucial role in spreading awareness of a just-launched product. These campaigns help you overcome the problem of not ranking in the early days of product launch. For product launch campaigns, you’ll want to bid more aggressively. Remember, in the initial days; you should be ready to operate at break-even point and even accept high ACOS. Leverage product targeting and show your ads on the detail page of one of your popular products. Showing ads on detail pages of your popular products can serve two purposes: (1) Your newly launched product will catch the eye of customers who are already interested in your brand and (2) if the product you are targeting has a good amount of reviews, it will serve as social proof for the new product.</p>
<h2>#8: Brand awareness campaign</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-77966 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8.jpg" alt="Brand awareness campaign" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /><br />
In this campaign, all your efforts should be focused on building or strengthening the awareness of your brand. Large and medium-sized brands should regularly implement brand awareness campaigns to maintain brand recall. Advertisers can leverage new-to-brand metrics to identify if their campaigns are reaching new customers or not. Brand awareness campaigns should target highly competitive keywords and have high bids. The only goal of brand awareness campaigns should be to increase the visibility and reach of your ads.</p>
<h2>#9: Retargeting campaigns</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-77967 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9.jpg" alt="Retargeting campaigns" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /><br />
Rather than trying to attract new visitors who may or may not convert, use Sponsored Ads Display campaigns to retarget repeat visitors who are more likely to convert. These ads appear on the product detail page or third-party websites and apps, depending on the targeting option you choose. With Sponsored Display Ads, you can retarget customers who’ve previously visited your detail page, target customers based on their interests and shopping behaviors, or target competing products and categories. Although Sponsored Display Ads were launched in 2019, only 25% of third-party sellers use it, making them one of the most underrated and underutilized ads.</p>
<h2>How to create an effective Amazon PPC strategy</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Decide on your campaign objective. Each of your campaigns can have different objectives. A few of them can be targeted towards improving brand awareness, while some of them can be focused on simply improving your sales.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Depending on your campaign objective, perform detailed keyword research. For brand awareness campaigns, your keywords should be related to your brand, and for product launch campaigns, you’ll need comprehensive keyword research consisting of the most common terms customers use to find your product.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the campaign type, again based on your campaign objective. If retargeting is your objective, choose Sponsored Display ad campaigns and if brand awareness is your objective, choose Sponsored Brand campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Set, bid and budget, add keywords and let the campaign run for at least a week before making any adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use ad reports to make tweaks in your campaigns. Continue reviewing and making adjustments in your campaign till you get the results you aimed for.</p>
<h2>That’s all for today</h2>
<p>Before deciding on your strategy, be sure to work on your campaign objectives and then plan on the tactics to achieve those objectives. Without fixating on what you’re trying to achieve, you cannot create campaigns based on assumptions. Include one or more of these campaigns in your strategy and see the difference in your KPIs from week 1. Schedule a meeting with your <a title="Amazon PPC consultant" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">PPC consultant</a> or take help from one of the <a title="Top Amazon PPC Agencies" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-marketing-services/">Top Amazon PPC Agencies</a> to help you get started with campaign creation and optimization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most misunderstood and misused tools on Amazon is Pay Per Click Ads. Every seller knows about it, every seller uses it, but only a handful know how to use it well. There are hundreds of misconceptions about PPC and these misconceptions grew to become myths. Sellers blindly follow them and when their campaigns don’t work, they wonder what went wrong. In this week’s blog post, I have revealed the ten most common myths that are gathered around Amazon PPC. Read, understand and stay away from them.</span></p>
<h4><b>Myth #1: PPC Is The Biggest Factor In Increasing Organic Ranking</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11781" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.jpg" alt="amazon ppc management experts" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until now, this was partly true. In Amazon’s old algorithm A9 PPC was one of the most significant factors to increase the organic ranking for the main keyword. However, </span><b>the updated algorithm A10 gives more importance to product relevancy and less weightage to sales driven from PPC. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, PPC is still relevant, but how it used to be. Amazon has finally understood that not all people buy products just because they keep on seeing it. So rather than advertising average products and giving them a coveted spot in the first line of search results, Amazon thinks that it would be best if the “most deserving and relevant” listing should win.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Fact: PPC is (not) the biggest factor in increasing your organic ranking. Advertising should be a way to bring immediate hype and it should not be used as a permanent solution.</strong></em></p>
<h4><b>Myth #2: No. 1 Position Is The Most Profitable Position</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11782" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.jpg" alt="amazon advertising expert" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, this is not entirely true. </span><b>Being in the first position gives your ad the best visibility and traffic possible. But that doesn’t always mean better conversion. You might actually end up spending more than what you are earning. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resultantly the ACOS is going to be very high. Most of the shoppers have the habit of clicking on the products on the first line of the SERP, but that doesn’t always mean they will buy the product. If your advertising goal is to increase brand awareness, then being in the first position can be very helpful. But not otherwise. However, like most advertisers using PPC, if your goal is to increase conversion, you should be a little cautious with being in the first position.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Fact: Don’t always set our goals for the #1 position. Experiment and find out which position works best for you.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>Myth #3: PPC Is A Set It &amp; Forget It Thing</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11783" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3.jpg" alt="amazon ppc management" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select product, add keywords, build campaigns and then wait for it to work. PPC seems to be very easy, doesn’t it? No! Like every other marketing effort, if you want to make the most of every dollar spent in your campaigns, you MUST monitor and adjust your PPC campaigns every day. Ad positions change every day, search trends change frequently and if you fail to adjust your campaigns according to these changes, then you may waste your precious advertising budget with nothing to earn. </span><b>Profitable PPC campaigns demand daily monitoring and optimization of KPIs, including spend, budget, clicks, ACOS and sales. In short, PPC is a process, a continuous and ongoing process you need to deal with till the time you sell on Amazon.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Fact: PPC is not a set-it-and-forget-it thing; it can never be. The only way you can put your PPC campaigns on auto-pilot mode is by hiring expert PPC consultants.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>Myth #4: PPC Prep Includes Only Thorough Keyword Research</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11800" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot_1-1.png" alt="amazon sponsored ads management" width="1101" height="550" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot_1-1.png 1101w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot_1-1-600x300.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot_1-1-300x150.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot_1-1-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot_1-1-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1101px) 100vw, 1101px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My PPC campaigns are jam-packed with the most profitable and high volume keywords; they are surely going to work. Well, sure, if your campaigns contain profitable keywords, it may bring loads and loads of traffic to your detail page, but that traffic is never going to convert into sales. So, only spend and no sales. When a shopper comes to your detail page and he is not fed with the information he needs to make a purchase, he will go away. As a result, the first and foremost step even before starting your PPC campaigns is to optimize your product content, create informative images, check whether your product has Buy Box or not and make sure your product has gleaming five-star reviews. </span><b>Bottom line: None of your PPC strategies and keyword research efforts are going to work unless and until your product detail page is retail-ready. Otherwise, the traffic you are bringing with the “great keyword research” is futile.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Fact: Before spending hundreds of dollars on PPC to bring traffic to your listing, invest in making your product detail page ready for the traffic.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>Myth #5: PPC Is Way Too Expensive</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11785" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.jpg" alt="amazon ppc management agency" width="697" height="416" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.jpg 697w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-600x358.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5-300x179.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPC is a bit expensive, but it can be tailored to fit your unique budget and needs. You may face loss in the beginning, maybe the cost of PPC is much more than your expectation, but you will have to be patient. </span><b>Always keep a cap on your budget; this way, you can decrease the chances of overspending, unless you make changes in your budget.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Another way to control your spend is by adjusting the bids regularly. </span><b>If a particular keyword is eating up your budget, then you can pause the keyword or decrease its bid.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PPC also allows you to target specific products and keywords to make your campaigns even more cost-efficient. So, you have complete control over your campaigns and their budget.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Fact: PPC is flexible and anyone with any budget can use it.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>Myth #6: More Keywords = More Sales</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11786" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.jpg" alt="amazon ppc agency" width="949" height="470" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6.jpg 949w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-600x297.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6-768x380.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not at all true. </span><b>Relevant keywords will bring you sales and not all keywords.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Having more and more keywords may bring more impressions, clicks and traffic, but that doesn’t always mean more sales. </span><b>Your PPC Campaigns should be focused on conversions and not just impressions and traffic.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instead of overstuffing your PPC campaigns with all the keywords you have, filter them on the basis of relevancy. </span><b>Overstuffing will bring irrelevant traffic, burn your budget and you will end up getting an unsatisfactory ROI. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micro-manage the performance of your keywords and adjust the keyword bids daily. We find the most profitable keywords from top-notch tools like Merchant Words, Helium10 and Jungle Scout. Trust me; campaigns built with these keywords will bring much better results.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Fact: More keywords Relevant keywords will bring better conversion and more sales.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>Myth #7: My Product Organically Ranks On Page #1 I Don’t Need PPC</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11787" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.jpg" alt="amazon ppc consultant" width="1121" height="414" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7.jpg 1121w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-600x222.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-300x111.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-1024x378.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/7-768x284.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a higher organic ranking is great, but using PPC can help you double your results when it comes to keeping your product in the top-of-the-mind of the customers. There is a chunk of sellers who believe that PPC and organic efforts work against each other, but </span><b>the reality is that they both work the best when used combined. The increased visibility can increase brand awareness and traffic.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes, we completely agree that free is obviously better than paid, but the importance and benefits PPC can bring cannot be neglected. At the same time, advertisers must make sure their business does not rely completely on PPC.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Fact: Paid and organic efforts work best when they are combined. PPC can help widen audience exposure and helps you to rank high for a broader range of keywords.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>Myth #8: ACOS Determines The Profitability Of Campaigns</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACOS doesn’t tell the whole story, or instead, it doesn’t tell the real story. A maximum number of sellers use ACOS (PPC Spend/PPC Sales) to determine the profitability of their campaigns. But ACOS only reflects one side of the coin. When it comes to Amazon, PPC spend is directly linked to organic sales</span><b>. If your PPC sales are higher than your organic sales, then it’s a warning bell for you.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PPC should have a snowball effect. Slowly and gradually, it should lead to organic sales and brand awareness. You are seriously destroying the performance of your campaign if you are relying solely on your ACOS. You should also count your total ROAS (total organic sales/PPC spend) and TACOS (</span><b>Advertising Spend / Total Revenue</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">). TACOS determines organic sales generated through PPC efforts and ROAS will tell you the same story of how PPC affects your organic ranking. </span><b>The point here is to make sure that your PPC sales should not be the main earning source of your business but a supplementary source.</b></p>
<p><b><i>Fact: ACOS is important, but it shouldn’t be your end-all metric. Do take into consideration other parameters such as TACOS and total ROAS.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>Myth #9: All About Bid Amount</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11788" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9.png" alt="amazon advertising expert" width="1365" height="499" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9.png 1365w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-600x219.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-300x110.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-1024x374.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/9-768x281.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1365px) 100vw, 1365px" /></p>
<p><b>If the bid is set at $1, it’s not always necessary that the whole amount will be deducted when someone clicks on the ad. Advertising bid determines the maximum amount you are willing to pay.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your bid is competitive enough and your ad is displayed in the search results and the customer clicks on the ad, then you will have to pay the amount, which is a little bit higher from the amount set by the first runner up. So it’s always better to set a somewhat higher bid on the relevant and essential keywords. This way, you can get the coveted position in the search result pages and maybe you won’t even have to pay that much. It is rightly said that when it comes to Amazon PPC, don’t play checkers; play chess. After all, PPC is a game and it’s okay to take some risk.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Fact: Higher bids don’t always mean a higher spend.</i></b></p>
<h4><b>Myth #10: I Can Do PPC All By My Myself</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPC demands time, expertise and efforts. As mentioned above, it is not a set-it-and-forget-it thing. It needs every day nurturing and fine-tuning to become profitable. If you manage everything in your Amazon account by yourself, you might not be able to do anything perfectly. </span><b>This is why smart sellers outsource <a title="PPC Management" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">PPC Management</a> to <a title="Amazon PPC Experts" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">PPC Experts</a> from experienced <a title="Amazon Agency" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon Agency</a> like eStore Factory.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just give us your advertising budget, sales target and target ACOS.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to measuring the success of your Amazon advertising campaigns, you look at the ACOS. But is it okay to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rely on ACOS? No doubt it is the most trustworthy metric, but from the past few months, TACOS is the “buzz” metric in sales and advertising conversions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being a major metric in measuring the success of your campaigns, ACOS does not show the real picture, the larger picture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us say we invest $10 in our Sponsored Product campaign. In some time, we get 10 orders and generate $100 worth of sales directly attributable to advertising. </span><b>So our ACOS will be 10%. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">But advertising sales isn’t the only metric which should be considered. What about the organic sales and brand awareness generated? Surprised? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be. The $10 you spent on Sponsored Product campaigns also helped your rank higher organically. The more sales you get on a product, the higher you rank. It doesn’t matter if that sale was achieved organically or because of Sponsored Ads. Also, these new customers were pleased with their purchase and left glowing reviews. All of these factors led to an increase in organic ranking and your customers are now easily able to find your product.</span></p>
<p>So in this example, let us say that the 10 orders raised our rank by 1 position. And as you rank higher organically, your organic sales also increased. This means that you have not just made sales of $100 but much more than that. What’s your ACOS now?<b> Still 10%.</b> Despite the increase in organic sales, there is no change in the ACOS. This is where ACOS fails. It does not tell the true value of your ad spend.</p>
<h4><b>Enter: TACoS</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total Advertising Cost of Sales or TACoS (not Tacos, the delicious Mexican delicacy) can help you measure your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">total ad spend</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relative to the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">total revenue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generated. The basic formula for TACoS is &#8211; <b>(Advertising Spend / Total Revenue) x 100. </b>While metrics like ACOS and RoAS are confined to measuring your advertising efforts, TACoS sheds light on your overall business performance. It helps you measure the effectiveness of advertising in the long term growth of your brand and also shows how much your business is relying on advertising.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6221" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4.jpg 1000w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-600x300.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h4><b>Interpreting TACoS Made Simple:</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like ACOS, the lower your TACoS is, the better. Conversely, a higher TACoS means your total sales are becoming more and more influenced by your advertising spend. Your ad spend is becoming a significant factor in your overall revenue, which is not what you want. Take a look at the below scenarios to understand TACoS better:</span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6234" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1-1.jpg" alt="" width="967" height="371" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1-1.jpg 967w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1-1-600x230.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1-1-300x115.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1-1-768x295.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 967px) 100vw, 967px" /></p>
<p>Let us take a closer look at each of these scenarios:</p>
<p><b>#1: TACoS Is Flat Or Decreasing &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This means that your advertising efforts are generating steady sales. It also indicates that the organic traffic and sales on that product are increasing, which means that your brand presence and customer reach is growing too! This is an ideal situation.</span></p>
<p><b>#2: TACoS Is Increasing &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It means that you are spending more on your advertising campaigns, but your organic sales are not increasing at the same rate. This is not the worst scenario, but it is not desirable either.</span></p>
<p><b>#3: TACoS &amp; ACOS Are Both Increasing &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This situation may not look very ideal, but sometimes, it would make total sense. For example, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product launch on Amazon</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While launching a new product, your only objective is to increase sales. If everything goes well and as planned, your TACoS, as well as ACOS, will decrease eventually.</span></p>
<p><b>#4: TACoS Is Increasing &amp; ACOS Is Decreasing &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This scenario is somewhat deceptive. You may be under the impression that your ACOS is decreasing, so everything is under control. But in reality, your organic sales are sinking lower and lower. organic sales are contributing a smaller portion in your total revenue while your ad spend is generating a larger portion. You are more dependent on advertising for generating sales, which is not a good sign. Ultimately this situation is shifting you away from your goal of boosting organic ranking and brand awareness.</span></p>
<h4><b>What Should Be The Ideal TACoS?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Good’ TACoS is relative to your brand size and its objective. If you have recently launched a product, you might have high TACoS and consequently, if most of the products are performing well then, your TACoS will be low. However, your goal should be to decrease your TACoS as much as possible. The ideal situation would be when your ACOS and TACoS are both decreasing simultaneously.</span></p>
<h4><b>How Can You Decrease Your TACoS?</b></h4>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6224" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3.jpg 1000w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-600x300.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize your product detail page to increase conversion rates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Control your ad spend and add a cap on your ad budget</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pause advertising campaigns on underperforming products. Scan your ad campaigns and see what products you are advertising that are not very profitable. Think again if you should continue to invest in advertising for these ASINs?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add negative and narrow match keywords to cut down on ad spend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try increasing your customer’s cart size. Use promotions, coupons and bundles to encourage customers to buy multiple units</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Not Just ACOS, TACoS Is Equally Important:</b></h4>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><u><strong>Do you know how many of your shoppers on Amazon actually come back and how many are new?</strong></u></h5>
<p>Well, Amazon has announced this new set of metrics which will help sellers know the cost of acquiring new customers so that they can better measure and optimize their brand’s marketing initiatives. According to the e-commerce behemoth, this metric will make John Wanamaker’s conundrum, “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don’t know which half,” a thing of the past.</p>
<h5><strong><u>What is Amazon New-To-Brand Metrics?</u></strong></h5>
<p>The new-to-brand metric allows advertisers to measure the orders and sales generated from the first time customers over the prior year. The order will be tagged as new-to-brand if the customer buys the brand’s product on Amazon for the first time in the last 12 months, starting from the present date. The look-back period includes all the purchase activity on Amazon and not just that is ad-driven.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Data will be available from November 1, 2018. If you select a start date prior to November 1, your new-to-brand metrics will be calculated using November 1 as the start date, so no data will be produced.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-754" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1.jpg" alt="Amazon Data" width="863" height="510" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This image is taken from Amazon.com for reference purpose.</p>
<h5><u><strong>With the introduction of new-to-brand metric, brand owners and advertisers will now be able to:</strong></u></h5>
<p>● Optimize campaign so that they can acquire new customers and drive loyalty from the existing customers<br />
● Identify and measure the cost to acquire new customers<br />
● Invent new marketing strategies to effectively reach the acquisition goals</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New-to-brand has given advertisers three new campaign performance metrics:</strong></span></h5>
<p>● Total new-to-brand purchase and sales<br />
● New-to-brand purchase rate<br />
● Cost per new-to-brand customer</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-755" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2.jpg" alt="Amazon brand Data" width="773" height="172" /></p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Marketers will be able to see campaign performance like:</strong></span></h5>
<p>● New-to-to-brand orders: The total number of orders on Amazon which are acquired by a brand from a new-to-brand customer over a one year look back window from the present date.<br />
● Percentage of new-to-brand orders: The percentage of total orders of advertised products which are purchased by new-to-brand customers.<br />
● New-to-brand sales: The total sales (in the local currency) of new-to-brand orders.<br />
● Percentage of new-to-brand sales: The percentage of total sales (in the local currency) of new-to-brand orders.<br />
● New-to-brand metrics can be viewed within your campaign performance dashboard and can also be extracted in report formats for display and video advertisers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3.png" alt="Amazon advertisement " width="753" height="186" /></p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New-to-brand metric is applicable for which advertisement types?</strong></span></h5>
<p>New-to-brand metric is available for Sponsored Brands (ads that populate on the top and bottom of the search result page), display and video advertisers (both purchased programmatically through Amazon) on all the Amazon marketplaces. All of the above three advertisement types are generally run by marketers to generate brand awareness.</p>
<p>It is only available for above mentioned three ad types and not for Sponsored products which is one of the most preferred ad tools, used by Amazon sellers. The main reason behind this is that <strong><a title="Sponsored Product Ads" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sponsored Product Ads</a></strong> are less expensive than other ad formats and is usually used for driving traffic and increasing discoverability for Amazon product pages.</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What does this new addition mean for advertisers?</strong></span></h5>
<p>New-to-brand will help the seller to determine whether the ad-attributed purchase was made by an existing customer or someone who has bought a brand’s product for the first time in the last 1 year. This will enable marketers to optimize campaigns to develop brand awareness and accelerate customer acquisition, relocate spend and plan strategies using 100 campaign reporting metrics.</p>
<p>This metric is extremely important if brands want to know how efficient advertising on Amazon was in winning new customers. It appeals to huge brands that are investing their marketing dollars on building brand loyalty as well as the growing brands who want to expand their customer base. Traditional yet major brand like Procter and Gamble will also look forward to this metric as they want to focus on search, ecommerce and social marketing for brand building.</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Why did Amazon release this metric?</strong></span></h5>
<p>Amazon is the most popular digital advertising platform after Google and Facebook and according to eMarketer, it had generated $4.61 billion (USD) ad revenue in 2018. The addition of this new metric will expand the retail giant’s appeal for performance-based advertisers who want to make data-driven decisions. This step may also draw a bigger marketing budget for Amazon advertising.</p>
<p>By introducing this metric, Amazon is trying to prove itself as a brand-awareness-driver, which will help it stand out amongst the traditional advertising platforms. So, new-to-brand can be considered as one of many steps that Amazon has taken to pull the market share from Google and Facebook.</p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What are the limitations?</strong></span></h5>
<p>● The 12-month time frame can be considered as a stumbling block for brands selling high-priced items because such products are not replaced frequently and so it may have fewer purchases.<br />
● The data is available from November 1, 2018, which is a short span of time when it comes to measuring brand loyalty.<br />
● This metric is not available for Sponsored products, which is the most popular type of ad amongst Amazon sellers.<br />
● At present, because of lack of brand name, there is a gap with Digital ASINs. Sellers who sell digital products like movie rentals, subscriptions and other non-physical good may lack a brand name and a sale generated from them may be included in reporting. Hence, if many of your orders are from Digital ASINs, it is not advisable to use new-to-brand metrics.</p>
<p>With this data in hand, advertisers will now have better insight into what is the cost of acquiring new customers and how they can shift strategies and apply tactics to accomplish their campaign goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has quietly set the stage to introduce three new bid optimization and ad placement features. These changes have been implemented in an attempt to optimize the visibility of the products on the advertising platform. The new features will improve the control and performance of your sponsored product ads.</p>
<p><strong><u>Three New Campaign Bidding Strategies:</u></strong><br />
Previously we used to set the bid for a keyword and Amazon would consider that exact bid for all the match types, irrespective of whether the click is going to convert or not. But now the bidding options have changed and they are available in the beta version of Sponsored Products. You can choose from any of the below three options while setting the bids:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-688" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-1-1.png" alt="Bidding on Sponsored Ads" width="552" height="303" /></p>
<p><strong>• Dynamic Bids – Down Only:</strong><br />
In Dynamic Bids – Down the Only strategy, Amazon will reduce your bids in real time for clicks that may be less likely to convert to a sale. Amazon will reduce the bid if the search query is not very relevant or the placement is not performing well. Under Dynamic Bids – Down Only option, Amazon can reduce your bid for up to 100%. As this strategy lowers the bids for the clicks that are less likely to convert, you can control the unprofitable clicks and spend.</p>
<p><strong><u>How it works:<u></u></u></strong><br />
For example, you are selling shoes and you have bid $1.00 for the keyword ‘Sports Shoes’. If Amazon finds an opportunity where your ad is less likely to convert to a sale, then it may lower the bid to $0.20 for that auction.</p>
<p><strong>• Dynamic Bids – Up &amp; Down:</strong><br />
In Dynamic Bids – Up &amp; Down strategy, Amazon will increase or decrease the bid on the basis of convertibility. It will increase the bids in real time for the clicks that are more likely to convert into sales and reduce them for the clicks that are less likely to convert to a sale. Under Dynamic Bids – Up &amp; Down option, Amazon will increase or decrease the bid for up to 100%. As this strategy adjusts your bid on the likelihood of conversion, it may give your ad more conversion as compared to other two strategies.</p>
<p><strong><u>How it works:</u></strong><br />
For example, you are selling shoes and you have bid $1.00 for the keyword ‘Sports Shoes’. If your ad is more likely to convert, Amazon may increase your bid to $1.40 and if the ad is not likely to convert, it may decrease the bid to $0.20.</p>
<p><strong>• Fixed Bids:</strong><br />
Under Fixed Bids strategy, Amazon will use your exact bid for all the opportunities. So, it won’t adjust the bids on based on the likelihood of conversion. In this bidding strategy, you can get more impressions, but fewer conversions for your ad spend.</p>
<p><strong><u>Adjust Bids By Placement:</u></strong><br />
Placement means the places across the Amazon detail page where your ad may appear. According to the new update, you can influence the view performance and placement of your sponsored ads on the basis of the bids. There are three placement groups:</p>
<p><strong>• Top of search:</strong> Your ad will reflect at the top row on the first page of search results.<br />
<strong>• Rest of the search:</strong> Your ad will reflect in the middle or bottom on the first page of search results.<br />
<strong>• Product pages:</strong> Your ad will reflect on the product detail page and certain other pages like add to cart page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-689" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-2-2.png" alt="Bid Adjustment" width="540" height="133" /></p>
<p><strong><u>How it works:</u></strong><br />
You can set a percentage increase to your base bid for the top of search and product pages placement. Your bid will be increased by the specified amount when your ad will compete for opportunities on those placements. If your base bid is $0.75 and you increase your bid by 50% for reflecting your ad on the top of the search, then your bid will be $1.13 for that placement and the dynamic bid could increase up to $2.26. This feature lets you set a 0% to 900% increase for the top of search and product pages placements.</p>
<p>For example, if you have set a bid of $1.00 on for a keyword and you set a 50% and 25% increase for the top of search and product pages respectively, then this is how your bids will be applied depending on campaign bidding strategy.</p>

<td colspan="2" width="289">&#8216;Adjust bids by placement&#8217; sets different bids by placement, and dynamic bidding adjusts these bids further based on the likelihood of a click converting to a sale. Under &#8216;dynamic bids &#8211; up and down&#8217;, Amazon may increase a bid by up to 100% for top of search (first page) and up to 50% for other placements. This leads to</p>
<p>· Top of search (first page): $1.00 increased by 50% = $1.50; which may be further increased to a maximum of $3.00 with dynamic bidding (100% increase from $1.50)</p>
<p>· Product pages: $1.00 increased by 25% = $1.25; which may be further increased to a maximum of $1.88 with dynamic bidding (50% increase from $1.25)</p>
<p>· Rest of search: $1.00 may be increased to a maximum of $1.50 with dynamic bidding (50% increase from $1.00)</td>
</tr>

<p><strong><u>How to change the bidding strategies of existing campaigns?</u></strong><br />
When you want to make changes in your bidding strategies later or want to edit the existing campaigns, click on the campaign you want to edit, navigate to the campaign settings and update your bidding selections.</p>
<p>The existing Sponsored Product campaigns will be moved to Dynamics bid – down only. With the introduction of the new bidding features, Bid+ is now being deprecated and the campaigns with Bid+ on will be moved to Dynamic bid down with a 50% boost on the Top of search placement.</p>
<p><strong><u>How to measure performance?</u></strong><br />
To determine the performance of your new bidding strategies, you can view the new Placements tab. It provides detailed information by the top of the search, rest of search and product pages placement groups. This data will give an insight into where your ads are showing and how they are performing under each placement so that you can make an informed marketing decision.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-690" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-3.png" alt="How to measure performance?" width="1364" height="372" /></p>
<p><strong><u>Impact on advertisers:</u></strong><br />
The new bidding and placement feature gives advertisers more control over ads as well as works to accelerate the visibility of the product. Previously, product ad placements were based on bids and sales performance, but now with the new update from Amazon, we can set a percentage increase to the base bid for increasing the likelihood of your ad being shown on the desired placement. Sellers can increase the bid for a particular percentage if the campaign is performing best for any of the placement. The Dynamic Bids &#8211; Down the Only strategy will help you reduce the unprofitable clicks and spend while Dynamic Bids – Up &amp; Down strategy makes sure we can get the most out of every dollar spent.</p>
<p>Choosing the right bidding strategy and placement for your ads is what can set you apart from the competition. <strong><a title="Amazon PPC optimization service" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon PPC optimization service</a></strong> providers like <strong>eStore factory</strong> can help you boost your campaign performance and sales.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last year witnessed the increase in revenue of the Amazon sellers with a huge boost in sales globally. However, Amazon suspended many sellers’ accounts for not complying with one condition or another. According to a survey, mostly 60% of the sellers fear that their account will be suspended may be based on the product sample, code violations, reportedly bad behavior by the clients or any kind of misconceptions caused through the Social Media platforms.</p>
<p>For this, it becomes necessary to take the professional <strong><a title="Amazon seller consulting services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seller-account-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon seller consulting services</a> </strong>from the premier company like eStore Factory. Here are few myths that are related to the Amazon’s Account Suspension so let’s debunk them to provide clearer information.</p>
<p><strong><u>Myths of Account Suspension</u></strong><br />
Amazon is one of the fastest growing E-commerce giants that has attained the top position on a global platform recently. Still, there are some common myths relative to Amazon account suspension.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shortcut for Reversal of Suspension</strong></span><br />
More than 50% of the sellers had their account suspended because of selling inauthentic items. The reason being most of the Amazon’s sellers are selling the items in the US market that accounts for almost 55% and in the UK, it accounts for nearly 31%. Most of the sellers think that if they have connections with some related people from Amazon, so they can get their account reinstated. However, the fact, if Amazon gets enough complaints about your products and services, then the account will be suspended. In order to maintain the authenticity of the Seller’s account, one can take the expert services from the <a title="Amazon consulting services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Amazon consulting</strong></a> services providers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Top Sellers does not get Suspension</strong></span><br />
It is a general myth that the sellers who are having great selling revenue on Amazon will not have their accounts suspended. Even if the sellers have more than $10 million of sales per year, the E-Commerce giant will handle their suspensions and reinstatement of the accounts equally. The sellers can take the Amazon marketing services from the right company so that they can get their accounts reinstated if Amazon has noticed any kind of vulnerability while accessing their accounts. Nearly, 81% of the Amazon sellers get their accounts reinstated after suspension after three days process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sellers think that Amazon Suspends Particular Account</strong></span><br />
Most of the Amazon sellers think that it is their account only that is being suspended every time. This is not the fact, because the sellers need to be vigilant about their inventories. If the complaints are received for particularly one seller to Amazon and after review, the false information is found, then their account will be suspended. This calls for experts of <strong><a title="Amazon product optimization services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon product optimization services</a></strong> from the foremost professionals who can optimize the seller’s products and ensure that the seller provides the best buying experience to its customers. It becomes necessary to adhere to guidelines about products set forth by the Amazon.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><br />
To sum up, it can be said that if the sellers are not complying with the set rules and regulations by the Amazon, then their accounts will be suspended eventually. The accounts can only be reinstated if the sellers’ answer to particular queries put up by Amazon and addresses the concerns of the buyers. If the sellers provide satisfactory answers to the concerns put up by the investigating executives, then they can rest assured of getting their account reinstated within a short time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Headline search ads are basically a form of keyword-driven Pay-Per-Click ads, infused with a bit more flexibility. They prove to be quite impactful as they stretch across the top of the search result page making them more noticeable than any other paid promotions.

Plus keyword-based targeting makes sure your ad is reaching the right audience at the right time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Headline search ads are basically a form of keyword-driven Pay-Per-Click ads, infused with a bit more flexibility. They prove to be quite impactful as they stretch across the top of the search result page making them more noticeable than any other paid promotions. Also, you can season and customize the product choice and click destination that differentiates your products from the conventional. Plus keyword-based targeting makes sure your ad is reaching the right audience at the right time.</p>
<p>Initially, headlines search ads were reserved for sellers operating through Vendor Central and Vendor Express or the sellers registering themselves as vendors just to take the advantages of the vendor privileges. In August 2017, it was extended for the 3rd Party sellers with brand registry. Recently, this dynamic e-commerce giant has introduced two updates which adds to the versatility and flexibility of Headline Search Ads.</p>
<p><strong><u>What’s New With Headline Search Ads:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>New Placements:</strong><br />
While sponsored ads were allotted multiple placements across the result page, headlines search ads used to be reflected only on the top of the page with different variations for desktop and mobile screens. But now your ad will show on two new destinations:</p>
<p>1) Left side of result page<br />
2) Bottom of the result page</p>
<p>These new placements are an excellent opportunity to escalate your brand awareness and make your presence felt amongst the similar looking products. You can take a look at this new format while you are in the process of creating the campaign.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New Bidding Options:</strong></span><br />
As for bids, Amazon has recently introduced two new bidding options: Automatic bidding and Custom or Manual bid adjustments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Automatic Bidding:</strong></span> Amazon will automatically optimize the bid to give a boost in conversion rates. For eg: Amazon will decrease bids for the ads or keywords that are less likely to trigger sales. As a seller, you can set the maximum CPC bid on a specific keyword; Amazon will never increase the bid than the specified limit.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Manual Bidding:</strong></span> While you turn off the automatic bidding option you need to set the bids manually. You can increase or decrease the bids as well as set the amount or percentage upto which you want to increase or decrease the bids.</p>
<p>With these two new updates, headline search ads got a much-needed refurbishing to compete with <strong><a title="Amazon sponsored product ads" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon sponsored product ads</a></strong>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you might have noticed, Amazon’s advertising reports have been updated within Seller Central (if your reports are not updated yet, they will over the next few weeks). Below are some key highlights of the changes that people found helpful.</p>
<p><strong><u>What has changed in reporting in Sponsored Products and Headline Search Ads for Sellers?</u></strong></p>
<p>1. <a title="Amazon Sponsored Products" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Amazon Sponsored Products</strong></a> ads are updated every hour, with data no older than 12 hours. Previously, data was updated every 4-8 hours with 48-72 hour old data which varied for each metric.</p>
<p>2. Sponsored Products data excludes cancelled orders.</p>
<p>3. Sponsored Products reports now have a custom date range in the last 60 days for product search term, purchased product, keyword, and placement reports.</p>
<p>4. Headline Search Ads keyword report now have a custom date range in the last 60 days for keyword report.</p>
<p>5. Headline Search Ads now has an account level report, which breaks down the performance of each keyword in each campaign.</p>
<p><strong><u>How does sales attribution work for sales of a specific ASIN on Seller Central Campaign Manager?</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sponsored Products for Sellers</strong>, sales attribution is tied to the Seller advertising. After a shopper clicks on the ad, Amazon will attribute any order that shopper places for that product and any of the Seller&#8217;s other products within 7 days. Within the Campaign Manager interface, we only show 1-week attribution for same SKU and other SKU&#8217;s aggregated sales. Sponsored Products sales exclude order cancellations and payment failures.</p>
<p><strong>Headline Search Ads</strong>, sales are attributed for the advertised product plus any products with the same brand as the advertised product, including sales by Amazon-sold (IP) ASINs and sales by third-party (3P) sellers. Sales are the total dollar value of your brand&#8217;s products sold to shoppers within 14 days of them clicking on your ad. Headline Search Ads attributed sales excludes cancelled orders and payment failures.</p>
<p><strong><u>Does date in the campaign manager match data in the downloadable reports?</u></strong></p>
<p>For both <strong><a title="Amazon Sellers" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Sellers</a> </strong>and Vendors, downloadable data is now in-line with campaign manager in terms of freshness and data granularity.</p>
