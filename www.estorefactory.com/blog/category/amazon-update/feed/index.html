										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is ever-changing. From introducing new metrics in Sponsored Brand Video ads to re-launching the European Fulfillment Network for UK sellers, the eCommerce behemoth has constantly been making tweaks to make it easier for the sellers to sell and the shoppers to buy. Sometimes amidst the chaos and the hustle, it can be difficult to keep up, which is why we have brought our monthly updates blog. Read on and stay updated.</p>
<h2>#1: Amazon brings back European Fulfillment Network</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78746 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.jpg" alt="Amazon brings back European Fulfillment Network" width="1140" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Post Brexit, Amazon sellers have been faced with a myriad of fulfillment challenges, including new additional charges, logistical difficulties, fees, customs, limited market reach and more. But these struggles are soon coming to an end. Amazon is reintroducing cross-border fulfillment between UK and EU marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>Their official announcement read:</strong></p>
<p>“Starting March 2022, fulfillment between the UK and the EU will reopen via the European Fulfillment Network, subject to European Fulfillment Network Fees. Eligible offers will become live in phases until May 2022.”</p>
<p>The European Fulfillment Network (EFN) allows sellers with an EU store account who are also registered in the FBA program to store their inventory in one of Amazon’s local Fulfillment Centers across Europe and fulfill their orders from other European stores.</p>
<p>Now that Amazon has re-enabled the EFN, UK sellers can again sell into European markets through UK fulfillment centers.</p>
<p><strong>To be eligible, you must:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Enroll in the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program, if not already</li>
<li>Enable export settings</li>
<li>Store inventory in UK fulfillment centers. The same stock-keeping unit (SKU) must be provided for both your UK and EU listings</li>
<li>Have access to both the UK and the EU Seller Central accounts</li>
<li>Ensure that the price of an eligible item does not exceed €135</li>
</ol>
<p>Schedule a meeting with your <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seller-account-management/" title="Amazon Account Management">Amazon account management</a> expert to discuss the next steps.</p>

<h2>#2: Amazon introduces themed templates in the ‘Customer Engagement’ (beta) tool</h2>
<p>Manage Your Customer Engagement tool was launched last year to give brand registered sellers an opportunity to engage and retarget their existing customers. Brands can send engaging emails to shoppers who opt to “follow” them. The follow+ button is featured in areas such as Amazon Seller Storefront &amp; Amazon Live. Until now, only new product announcements and product spotlight templates were available, but recently, Amazon has introduced new holiday-themed templates that’ll allow you to create more diverse and attractive content for your followers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78747 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2.jpg" alt="Amazon introduces themed templates in the ‘Customer Engagement’ (beta) tool" width="1024" height="793" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-500x387.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-800x620.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-600x465.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><strong>The official announcement read:</strong></p>
<p>“You can now create themed email campaigns within the Customer Engagement tool. Multiple holiday banners are available, with new templates being launched monthly. With these themed templates, you can suggest gifts for upcoming holidays, New Year resolutions, travel adventures, game day, and other occasions.”</p>
<p>It is recommended to have at least 1000 followers before starting email campaigns. You can see how many followers you have by going to Manage Stores &gt; Store Insights.</p>
<p>Your email campaigns will be as effective as your content. To ensure more and more customers engage with your emails, hire <a title="Amazon Photo Editing Services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-photo-editing-services/">Amazon photo editing services</a> and let them create custom banners for your template.</p>

<h2>#3: New changes to buyer-initiated order cancellations</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78748 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3.jpg" alt="New changes to buyer-initiated order cancellations" width="1140" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Keeping in mind seller’s feedback, Amazon has introduced a better way to cancel orders without searching for buyer canceling requests in the Buyer-Seller messaging tool. It was easy to miss cancellation requests as they can be lost among multiple buyer-seller messages. Effective April 27, 2022, Amazon is making changes to the process of managing buyer canceling requests to make it more efficient and hassle-free.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancelation requests will appear in a banner on the Manage orders page.</li>
<li>Notifications will no longer be sent through Buyer-Seller messaging.</li>
<li>Cancelation requests can be seen in order reports. You will have to enable the Buyer-Requested Cancel field for visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sellers and <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seller-account-management/" title="Amazon Seller Consultants">Amazon seller consultants</a> can still use the buyer-seller messaging tool to communicate with and contact the customers. If a customer cancels an order through the buyer-seller messaging tool, you can instruct them to cancel their orders on their Your orders page.</p>

<h2>#4: Amazon helps non-US sellers simplify returns</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78740 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4.jpg" alt="Amazon helps non-US sellers simplify returns" width="1140" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-300x118.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-768x303.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-500x197.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-800x316.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-600x237.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Amazon recently announced a new program that’ll help foreign sellers simplify returns. Amazon’s return policy states that “Third-party sellers must either provide a return address within the United States, provide a prepaid return label, or offer a full refund without requesting the item be returned. If a seller does not offer these methods to return your items, you may file an A-to-z Guarantee claim to seek help with your return.”</p>
<p>With the new Returns Provider program, non-US sellers who don’t have a US return address can connect with the service providers and manage returns.</p>
<p>As the cost of sending returned items to international addresses is not viable, Amazon has introduced this new program that introduces sellers to a service provider who can process returns for them. However, it is still unclear if hiring a service provider will be a cheaper alternative or not.</p>
<p><strong>The <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/forums/t/simplify-us-seller-fulfilled-returns-with-the-new-returns-provider-program/957355/14">official announcement</a> read:</strong></p>
<p>“Using the program simplifies domestic returns, allows you to recoup return costs, and ensures a seamless customer returns experience. Once enrolled in the program, you can receive Prepaid returns for seller-fulfilled orders with the provider’s domestic warehouse address, enabling you to further streamline customer returns.”</p>
<p>The program was open for a selected group of international sellers on 22nd Feb 2022 and will be open to all sellers by March 2022.</p>
<h2>#5: Key video metrics introduced in Sponsored Brand Video Ads</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78741 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5.png" alt="Key video metrics introduced in Sponsored Brand Video Ads" width="594" height="438" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5.png 594w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-300x221.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-500x369.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /></p>
<p>Sponsored Brand Video Ads are one the most impactful forms of advertising. Boasting a high click-through rate, these scroll-stopping wonders help engage shoppers at high intent stages of their buying journey. The recent addition of new metrics has made it easy for the advertisers and <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/" title="Amazon PPC Experts">Amazon PPC optimization experts</a> to make data-driven decisions and improve the performance of their video ad campaigns. The new metrics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewable Impressions:</strong> Shows each time 50% of the video ad’s screen size is visible for 2 seconds straight while it is playing.</li>
<li><strong>View-Through Rate (VTR):</strong> Shows how many times a shopper has seen an ad from start to finish.</li>

<h2>#6: Sponsored Display enables portfolio functionality</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78742 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6.png" alt="Sponsored Display enables portfolio functionality" width="1294" height="390" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6.png 1294w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-300x90.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-1024x309.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-768x231.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-500x151.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-800x241.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-1280x386.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-600x181.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1294px) 100vw, 1294px" /></p>
<p>Amazon has enabled portfolio where advertisers can organize their CPC-based Sponsored Display campaigns with their Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brands campaigns and categorize them by brand, product category, product line, organizational structure, or season. This allows brands to control spend and review campaigns performance across a collection of campaigns they’ve organized. Once your portfolio budget is exhausted, all campaigns in that portfolio will automatically pause until you choose to reactivate them by increasing your portfolio budget.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the feature available?</strong></p>
<p><strong>North America:</strong> United States, Canada, Mexico<br />
<strong>Europe:</strong> Spain, Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands<br />
<strong>Middle East:</strong> United Arab Emirates<br />
<strong>Asia Pacific:</strong> India, Japan, Australia</p>
<h2>#7: Sponsored Display budget rules now available globally</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78743 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7.png" alt="Sponsored Display budget rules now available globally" width="915" height="581" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7.png 915w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-300x190.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-768x488.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-500x317.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-800x508.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-600x381.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 915px) 100vw, 915px" /></p>
<p>Similar to Sponsored Product ads, advertisers can now set campaign budget in advance using two types of budget rules. Budget rules greatly eliminate manual efforts to adjust the budget and ensure your campaigns don’t go out of budget. There are two types of budget rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule-based rules allow you to set a budget on peak shopping days like Prime Day or Black Friday. With this rule, you can increase the campaign budget during the date range you set in the rule or during the special event selected.</li>
<li>Performance-based rules allow you to set rules to increase your sponsored products campaign budgets only when your campaigns meet performance thresholds. You can set performance thresholds using metrics like advertising cost of sales (ACOS), click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits of Sponsored Display budget rules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Helps ensure high-performance campaigns don’t run out of budget</li>
<li>Helps prevent missed opportunities</li>
<li>Improves the chances of receiving additional clicks and sales</li>
<li>Lets you plan budget in advance for holiday and sales events</li>
<li>Reduces manual effort</li>
</ul>
<h2>#8: Launch new campaigns using bulksheets</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-78744 size-full" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8.png" alt="Launch new campaigns using bulksheets" width="1090" height="570" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8.png 1090w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8-300x157.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8-1024x535.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8-768x402.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8-500x261.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8-800x418.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8-600x314.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px" /></p>
<p>Advertisers can use bulksheets to create and optimize <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com.au/amazon-sponsored-ads/" title="Sponsored Display Ad">Sponsored Display ad</a> campaigns at scale. The bulksheets include performance metrics, including cost per click (CPC), return on ad spend (ROAS), and conversion rate to support better optimization down to keyword level. This new feature is designed to reduce manual effort and save time. Advertisers can create campaigns in bulk, create multiple ad groups in a campaign and manage thousands of keywords at once. Amazon recommends using bulk sheets for campaign optimizations, campaign creation, and reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the feature available?</strong></p>
<p><strong>North America:</strong> United States, Canada, Mexico<br />
<strong>South America:</strong> Brazil<br />
<strong>Europe:</strong> Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom<br />
<strong>Middle East:</strong> United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia<br />
<strong>Asia Pacific:</strong> Australia, India, Japan, Singapore</p>
<h2>#9: Amazon files a lawsuit against sellers for posting fake reviews</h2>
<p>Last week, Amazon filed a lawsuit against two brokers who are accused of posting incentivized misleading reviews in exchange for money or free products. These two major fake review brokers, AppSally and Rebatest mislead shoppers by having their members try to post fake reviews in stores such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and Etsy.</p>
<p>Dharmesh Mehta, VP of WW Customer Trust &amp; Partner Support, Amazon, said, “Fake review brokers attempt to profit by deceiving unknowing consumers and creating an unfair competitive advantage that harms our selling partners. We know how valuable, trustworthy reviews are to our customers. That is why we are holding these review fraudsters accountable. While we prevent millions of suspicious reviews from ever appearing in our store, these lawsuits target the source.”</p>
<p>To ensure a safe and trustworthy shopping experience, Amazon uses machine learning technology, skilled investigators and more than 10,000 employees to protect its store from frauds, which also include fake reviews. In 2020, the retail giant removed more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer.</p>
<p>It’s still beyond our understanding why sellers opt to incentivize reviews rather than playing it safe by increasing reviews through white hat techniques.</p>

<h2>#10: Amazon’s reminder to sellers regarding price gouging</h2>
<p>In order to protect its customers and ensure fair pricing, Amazon has reminded sellers to set fair prices for all their products, especially COVID-related products like masks and test kits.</p>
<p>In 2020, the retail giant removed hundreds of thousands of “high-priced offers” and suspended thousands of sellers who were engaged in price gouging activities. In the same year, sellers were fined for charging exorbitant prices on hand sanitizer and other cleansing products.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Marketplace Fair Pricing policy protects customers from unfair, excessive, and misleading prices. Sellers who don’t comply with this policy may face offer removal or account suspension.</p>
<p>This is a reminder to sellers to check their <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/pricing/health/ref=xx_xx_dnav_xx">Pricing Health</a> page and restore any listings that may have been deactivated in accordance with Amazon’s Fair Pricing policy.</p>
<h2>#11: FBA shipment policy updates</h2>
<p>To streamline their shipment operations, Amazon has introduced a new set of rules. Effective April 1, 2022, if sellers send canceled or deleted shipments to Amazon, their shipment may be rejected, and the ability to send additional shipments may also be suspended.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon has suggested sellers to follow the below guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When creating a shipping plan, specify the quantity, content, and other information that might affect the distribution of the shipments.</li>
<li>After approving the shipping plan, be sure to send the shipment to the assigned fulfillment center with the quantity and content specified in the plan.</li>
<li>After approving a multi-destination shipping plan, do not delete any part of the shipment or send the shipment along a different route. Make sure that all of the shipments in the multi-destination plan arrive at our fulfillment center within 30 days of our receipt of the first shipment.</li>
<li>Make sure your FBA box ID label is clearly visible.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations, you have successfully entered the year 2021! Holidays are over and so is 2020. The pandemic has accelerated online shopping by almost 30%. Amazon announced on seller central, &#8220;Independent businesses … nearly all of which are small- and medium-sized businesses, have surpassed $4.8 billion in worldwide sales so far this holiday season. That&#8217;s an increase of over 60% from last year&#8221;. Amongst the hustle and bustle of the holidays, you might have missed out on the important updates taking place in Amazon. <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/" title="Amazon Marketing Consultants">Amazon marketing consultants</a> at eStore Factory has made a comprehensive list of need-to-know updates going on within Amazon. Read on and stay updated.</p>
<h2>#1: Measuring Organic vs. PPC Sales is now easy</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67893" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.png" alt="Amazon Marketing Consultants" width="1245" height="589" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.png 1245w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-300x142.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-1024x484.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-768x363.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-500x237.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-800x378.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-600x284.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1245px) 100vw, 1245px" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s my organic vs. PPC sales ratio? This question has been asked for generations and sought for ages. The answer has eluded you until now, but now Amazon has made it easier to find the organic and PPC sales per product. The seller central dashboard shows a graphical representation of organic and PPC sales of the product or all products of your catalog.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to find organic vs. paid traffic, let us find the ideal ratio of organic and paid sales. From our experience, most successful sellers earn approximately 30-40% of their total sales from paid search. It would be a missed opportunity to neglect PPC, especially if your product is relatively new or you are selling in a crowded niche where organic spots on page #1 are limited. Organic and paid search belong together – you only need to find the sweet spot suitable for your business.</p>
<h2>#2: New Search Terms Report feature available for Brand Analytics</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67894" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.png" alt="New Search Terms Report feature available for Brand Analytics" width="1912" height="936" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2.png 1912w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-300x147.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1024x501.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-768x376.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-500x245.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-800x392.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1280x627.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1536x752.png 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1568x768.png 1568w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-600x294.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1912px) 100vw, 1912px" /></p>
<p>Recently Amazon has introduced a new report showing how customers (in aggregate) find your competitors&#8217; products in the Amazon stores. The metrics include the relative search popularity, click share, conversion share for each of the top three clicked products for a given search term and the ASINs that have dropped from the top three clicked products for a given search term. This data can help you better understand which of your products might be losing search relevancy, and you can adjust your product&#8217;s main image, title, and advertising campaigns to generate more traffic. Amazon brand analytics is available free to brand owners enrolled in the brand registry.</p>
<h2>#3: Removal of commenting feature from product reviews</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67896" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3.gif" alt="Removal of commenting feature from product reviews" width="988" height="742" /></p>
<p>For years, Amazon sellers have used the comment section to respond to negative reviews left by angry shoppers. However, recently, Amazon has announced that they will be discontinuing this feature, saying, &#8220;it was rarely used.&#8221; Although Amazon thinks this feature wasn&#8217;t used enough, removing it will negatively impact the seller&#8217;s ability to engage with customers and correct misperceptions.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67885" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4.png" alt="Removal of commenting feature from product reviews" width="570" height="334" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4.png 570w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-300x176.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-500x293.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>
<p>If you are one of those sellers who used the comments section of the reviews to make the product heard, don&#8217;t be disappointed. You can still click on the &#8220;helpful&#8221; or &#8220;not helpful&#8221; button to show your appreciation or disapproval. Sellers can also use the customer question and answer section to reply about the aspects of the product.</p>
<h2>#4: Upload your product images faster</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67886" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1.png" alt="Upload your product images faster" width="1353" height="552" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1.png 1353w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1-300x122.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1-1024x418.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1-768x313.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1-500x204.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1-800x326.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1-1280x522.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-1-600x245.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1353px) 100vw, 1353px" /></p>
<p>To make the image uploading process easier for the sellers, Amazon has introduced a bulk image uploading tool. Sellers can now upload up to 5 GB worth of product images at once with the bulk image upload tool and view the status of all your uploads in the image upload status report in Seller Central. Previously, you could upload images for only one product at a time, which was tedious and time-consuming if you had to upload images for a lot of products at once. But with the introduction of this tool, sellers can streamline the image uploading process. If you need any help in creating and uploading enticing image for Amazon, hire our <a title="Amazon Product Photography" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-photo-editing-services/">Amazon photo editing services</a>.</p>
<h2>#5: Amazon posts get a new metrics</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67887" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6.png" alt="Amazon posts get a new metrics" width="750" height="386" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6.png 750w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-300x154.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-500x257.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-600x309.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Released as a beta version in 2019, Amazon Posts allows brands to create Instagram-like looking posts of their products. Each post links to your product detail pages, making them instantly shoppable. Amazon Posts functions exactly like a social media feed. You post brand-curated content to help shoppers bring closer to your products. Recently Amazon has introduced a new metric called &#8220;reach&#8221; that shows the number of unique customers who saw your posts. Until now, the metrics available were only: viewable, impressions, engagement, engagement rates and now, reach. Although the introduction of new metrics will help sellers improve the performance of posts, we still have real sales KPIs.</p>
<p>Note: Posts is available only to the sellers in the US marketplace.</p>
<h2>#6: Improvement for your Expiration Date ASIN creation</h2>
<p>By filling out the attributes properly, you help create a seamless intake process and proper tracking of products at fulfillment centers, so products that are past their prime can be removed before reaching customers.</p>
<h2>#7: New Subscribe &amp; Save performance dashboard now available</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67888" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1.jpg" alt="New Subscribe &amp; Save performance dashboard now available" width="1500" height="350" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1.jpg 1500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-300x70.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-1024x239.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-768x179.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-500x117.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-800x187.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-1280x299.jpg 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-600x140.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>

<h2>#8: <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/" title="Amazon Sponsored Ads">Amazon Sponsored Ads</a> and Stores launched in Brazil</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67889" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-1.jpg" alt="Amazon Sponsored Ads and Stores launched in Brazil" width="1140" height="600" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-1-1024x539.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-1-768x404.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-1-500x263.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-1-800x421.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-1-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Sponsored product ads, sponsored brand ads &amp; <a title="Amazon seller storefront" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-storefront-design/">Amazon seller storefront</a> are now available to sellers in Brazil. This is a big change as now sellers can leverage these new advertising solutions to reach their goals easily. Amazon had strategically launched these new features right before the holiday season so sellers can increase visibility for their holiday discounts and deals, introduce products and brands to new shoppers in Brazil and scale a new product launch.</p>
<p>Sponsored product ads help sellers get instant visibility and drive discoverability of a product, sponsored brand ads help build a brand and generate awareness while stores help showcase your complete product catalog.</p>
<h2>#9: Sponsored Display reports available</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67890" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9.png" alt="Sponsored Display reports available" width="1154" height="368" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9.png 1154w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9-300x96.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9-1024x327.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9-768x245.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9-500x159.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9-800x255.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/9-600x191.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1154px) 100vw, 1154px" /></p>
<p>Sponsored display ads are a self-service display advertising solution that allows sellers to target shoppers who have previously viewed your products or similar products by using relevant search terms. It was launched back in 2019 to empower vendors and brands of all sizes to expand their reach and avail the benefits of retargeting. Until now, to improve the performance of Sponsored Display Ad campaigns, sellers had to analyze in the advertising console, going through each and every campaign but now, roughly after 2 years, Amazon has introduced reporting in sponsored display ads. Just filter and analyze the data using spreadsheets, just like we do in sponsored product ad campaigns.</p>
<h2>#10: New Product Types and Attributes Available</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-67891" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10.png" alt="New Product Types and Attributes Available" width="1920" height="1504" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10.png 1920w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-300x235.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-1024x802.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-768x602.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-500x392.png 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-800x627.png 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-1280x1003.png 1280w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-1536x1203.png 1536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-1568x1228.png 1568w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/10-600x470.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></p>
<p>In December 2020, Amazon introduced new Product Types and attributes to help improve your product detail pages. When creating a new listing, sellers can view these new product types when classifying your product in the Add a product tool in Seller Central. Sellers can also see the product types when you select the appropriate template to download on Add Products via Upload. These changes might not affect your existing selection, but you can provide these additional attributes by editing your products via Manage Inventory or by updating your listings in bulk.</p>
