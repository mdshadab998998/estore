<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Carlo, the owner of a haircare brand, decided it was time to reassess his brand’s PPC strategy when he found that his ad spend and ACOS has been constantly increasing while the sales were almost stable. He considered hiring <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon advertising experts</a> to handle his ad campaigns full time. After investigating a handful of <a title="PPC Consultants" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/">PPC consultants</a> and agencies, he chose eStore Factory as his trusted partner. During the initial project discussions, he made it clear that his main goal behind hiring experts is to reduce ACOS along with PPC revenue growth. Considering the uber-competitive category he was selling in, it wasn’t easy, but our team left no stone unturned. Not so surprisingly, we reached the target ACOS even before the target date and that’s when the foundation of a long-lasting relation was placed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Challenges:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our biggest challenge was maintaining profitability and ACOS in one of the most competitive categories on Amazon. There were big players already sitting on the most profitable spots, so we had to increase the bids and higher bids equals higher ACOS. Controlling ACOS is neither impossible nor unachievable, but our <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon PPC specialists</a> had a time limit for it which was the real challenge. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Actions:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our first step was to clean up wasted spend and identify opportunities for increased targeting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">We created both automatic and manual campaigns to collect data, drive sales and improve visibility</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few weeks, we started getting results and then we did <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon ad optimization</a> based on performance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Negative keyword harvesting on a daily basis helped us the most in controlling the ACOS</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Micro-level bid tweaking dramatically reduced extra spend and optimized keyword performance</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As the PPC revenue was already increasing at a faster rate than its ad spend, we had the opportunity to up the ACOS a tad and achieve better revenue without affecting the profitability</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Results:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Within just two months the PPC orders grew from 826 to 1012</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">We reached the target ACOS of below 20% before the 1 month time period and our consistent efforts decreased it even further</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The ACOS in February 2020 was reduced to 17.29% from 23.12% in December 2019</span></li>

<h4><b>All it takes to be successful on Amazon is consistent efforts and a well-thought plan</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s been 9 months since working with Carlo and his company has experienced a never-seen-before advertising growth and increased profitability. Based on the strength of the partnership, the company happily handed the management of its UK and CA account to eStore Factory&#8217;s <a title="Amazon Consultants" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon Consultants.</a> Our relationship with Carlo is sure going to last much longer as we still have a lot of milestones to achieve. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elisabet, a US-based Amazon seller, wanted to maximize visibility and sales for the only product she was selling. She had high hopes that the product could do wonders if marketed and presented the right way. However, in the backdrop of high competition, her listing did not get the much-needed traffic and visibility. After having several failed attempts at working with average <a title="Amazon Consultants" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon consultants</a>, she finally found eStore Factory. It had been only a few months since we started working on her account and just during the tumultuous times of COVID-19, her product broke all the past sales records.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Challenges:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge our <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/">Amazon PPC consultants</a> was to take a product with practically zero visibility and make it successful. Although the listing looked optimized and rich, it lacked the right keywords and as a result, the product was placed deep within the search result pages, making it impossible for the shoppers to notice and purchase the product. Moreover, the PPC campaigns were poorly managed and organized.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Actions:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first, we took a look at Elisabet’s product listing and thoroughly analyzed to identify the opportunities for improvements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also analyzed the competitor’s arena to understand what can be done to bring the product at par with the top sellers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then our <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/">Amazon SEO experts</a> tweaked the product detail page so that it’s in line with Amazon’s A9 algorithm</span></li>
<li>With the SEO friendly <a title="Product Listing Optimization" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/">product listing optimization</a> and a comprehensive list of keywords derived from <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-keyword-research/">Amazon keyword research tools</a>, we started PPC for an immediate sales boost. Amazon’s algorithm picked the relevant keywords from the listing and displayed ads in front of the audience who were looking for a product similar to Elisabet’s.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the listing became more and more noticed, we began to see a dramatic increase in the traffic, which eventually converted to sales.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Results:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elisabet came to us last year. Within just three weeks of working with us, she saw a considerable increase in sales and there has been no looking back since then.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-month orders increased from 63 in 2019 to 175 in April 2020. Consecutively the sales volume has increased from $3,149 to $8,748</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PPC efforts obviously brought about excellent results in PPC sales, but our achievement here was the increase in profitability. Even though the PPC sales had increased, the spend decreased from $345 to $760.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACOS decreased by nearly 10% from 32.66% to 23.06%. Our short term goals for her account includes decreasing ACOS below the threshold of 20% while still maintaining the momentum of ad revenue.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Challenge:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The products were launched in 2018, but amidst competition, the listings did not receive the much-needed traffic. Plus, there were already a few players in the market who were ruling the prime positions in both paid and organic search results. Our challenge was to launch a strategy that can put the products on the same level as the competitors. Not to forget, we had to run and manage PPC in four marketplaces.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Action:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Although we had already done <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-keyword-research/" title="Amazon Keyword Research">Amazon keyword research</a> during optimization, we did it again to find unique, most searched terms shoppers are using in 2020. The keyword research we did had a healthy mix of high search volume keywords and long-tail queries accompanied by low volume keywords. Without finding those phrases, it was impossible to drive traffic</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The next stage was to use the enhanced and updated keyword list to run PPC campaigns to drive the much-awaited traffic and sales. Sponsored product ads were leveraged to take the product off the ground and get the ball rolling. Sponsored Brand ads were used to increase brand recall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Amazon’s A9 (now called A10) algorithm instantly picked the relevant keywords from the listing and we began to see traffic pour down towards her listing. Because the product detail page was already retail ready with content and images, we were never worried about conversion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As Amazon PPC optimization is not a set-it-and-forget-it thing, we scaled bids, populated campaigns with new keywords and added negative keywords on a daily basis</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Results:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">By combining multiple advanced advertising tactics, we were able to deliver record-breaking results with a 70% increase in sales in just one month</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite a $61881 rise in ad revenue, we were still able to maintain the ACOS at 8.48%, which was decreased from 19.16%. As these placements were highly competitive, it took some time to get a good hold on sales and reduce ACOS, but in the end, we were able to bring in great results.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">While advertising growth is noteworthy, our organic efforts had also started to shown its effect as there was a sharp increase in total sales from $168197 to $230078</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tony owns a well-established company that mainly specializes in providing health and skincare products. He has more than 50 products under his umbrella, which were performing fairly well under its category. However, in light of increasing competition and ever-changing customer demand, the sales plateaued. But like every ambitious Amazon seller, Tony too was determined to break the cycle. That’s when Tony decided to hire eStore Factory&#8217;s <a title="Amazon Consulting Services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon consulting services</a> to help him create a new strategy that can break the decreasing sales trend and take his products to new heights. Read on to know how our <a title="Amazon SEO Experts" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/">Amazon SEO experts</a> helped this prominent brand get its deserved market share.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Challenge:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tony came to us with a product catalog that was already raking in decent revenues. For a million-dollar seller like him, steady revenue was never a problem. However, because of the new brands coming to the marketplace, he was facing a problem all the name brands do – the revenue was reaching a saturation point. The challenge our<a title="Amazon Experts" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/"> Amazon experts</a> was to devise a strategy that can bring tony back his lost sales without risking his present market share.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Actions:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our initial steps included taking a deeper dive into the competitor’s listings that were capturing the market. This helped us understand where the product lags</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Thorough research of our product catalog helped us identify the key aspects that needed to be improved. We realized that there was a drop in visibility and conversion which were accompanied by underwhelming sales. To tackle both the issues we resorted to <a title="Product Listing Optimization" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/">product listing optimization</a> of all the products in his catalog. Soon the conversion improved and organic ranking accelerated</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now to bring in the traffic, our <a title="Amazon Ranking Experts" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/">Amazon ranking experts</a> launched multiple campaigns targeting all the profitable keywords. The list of keywords was collected after careful consideration from popular <a title="Amazon Keyword Research Tools" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-keyword-research/">Amazon keyword research tools</a> like Merchant Words and Helium10</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Weekly review of the search term report helped us scale the bids and optimize the campaigns on the basis of profitability</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Results:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">When we launched the first set of campaigns, the ACOS was 27% which was reduced down to 23%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, PPC sales increased from 119,793 to 135,875</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our strategies also led to a few of Tony’s product regaining the dominant position on the search result pages in both organic and paid results</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, all of his primary products gained momentum and were minting commendable sales. A few of the selected products have even got the coveted “Amazon’s Choice” badge</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The increase in sales was seen during the tumultuous times of COVID-19 which itself was an achievement for Tony and us</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>It’s all about being consistently successful:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before joining hands with eStore Factory, Tony already had impressive sales figures, but the graph was rather getting flat. Following the actions taken by our team of <a title="Amazon PPC Consultants" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/">Amazon PPC consultants</a>, we elevated his sales and brand presence back to prominence. Their sales number, as you can see in the above screenshots, is better than ever.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Challenge:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenges included poorly-optimized product contents followed by low conversion and a lack of PPC strategy. We had to start everything from scratch and there were a lot of expectations to live up to. In short, there was so much to do and the time to gain trust was limited.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Actions:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin with, we performed content optimization to aid in the organic discovery and better PPC conversion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the period of 6 months, we successfully launched a couple of products with strategic product launch planning and execution</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reorganization of catalog by clubbing the product variations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creation of new listing images and A+ Pages to build positive brand reputation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PPC management and optimization to get an instant boost in sales and ranking</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Challenge:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Increasing PPC sales is just about adding hundreds of keywords in the campaign, but increasing PPC sales while also maintain profitability was the biggest challenge we had. The target ACOS client gave was below 3%, which is hard to achieve, harder to maintain. This ACOS number is something every seller dreams about; achieving it is a different story. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gerry began selling on the Amazon marketplace a few years ago, focusing on healthcare supplement products. We began working with him in 2018 and in a matter of two years; there have been many celebration-moments for both of us. From the very beginning, Gerry felt the difference of working with true professionals because of which he trusted us for managing the Amazon store of one of his child companies as well. Our most recent achievements with Gerry’s account was when there was an increase in PPC sales and reduce in ACOS during the tumultuous times of COVID-19.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Challenge:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PPC is a risky, little game as an increase in PPC sales comes with a price tag of high ACOS. As Gerry had set a threshold for ACOS, we had to juggle between increasing advertising sales and maintaining profitability. Not to forget, the category Gerry was selling in was one of the most competitive on Amazon, meaning it demands more spend for achieving our target sales.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Action:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital shelf analysis to spot the areas of improvements in search, content and ratings</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Strategic review of the customer’s arena to identify demand generation opportunities. Our specific lens was on campaign management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Creation of both automatic and manual Sponsored Product campaigns for better visibility and Sponsored Brand campaigns for enhancing brand recall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Restructuring and optimization of existing ad campaigns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Positive and negative keyword harvesting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Automating the pricing to combat lost buy box share</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Proactive inventory management to ensure there is always just-enough stock at the Amazon warehouses</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Results:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our target ACOS was 15%, but we managed to drive it down to a record-breaking 11.45%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">From November to May, the company saw a massive jump in sales from $28720 to $47179</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Total sales increased to nearly $244511 from $158297</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The average orders increased by 153% from 5675 to 8706</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our efficient inventory management enabled us to fulfill our orders without any interruptions or gaps during COVID-19</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The company was selling 1845 highly-competitive, active SKUs. The challenge was to make sure each and every SKU gets required attention and exposure. Plus, we didn’t automate any part of our PPC management process; everything from keyword research to bid optimization was done by leveraging human intelligence and not via AI or tools.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Actions:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Analyzing market dynamics and shopper’s demand for some of the top-selling ASINs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Identifying the products which were not receiving optimal exposure</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Creation of various sponsored product campaigns as well as optimization of existing low-performing campaigns</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">As a part of the process, we also helped Stephen identify impactful keywords that are driving sales</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Making dedicated campaigns with top-selling keywords, low ACOS keywords, keywords with ACOS that should be optimized</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Negative keyword harvesting to keep a tap on ACOS</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Results:</b></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Between December to May, the company experienced a 38% increase in sales from $124,555 to $301,698</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">With regards to PPC sales, the company saw a jump from </span><span style="font-weight: 400">$38,514 to $101,194</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the commendable increase in PPC sales, the ACOS decreased from 25% to 16%</span></li>
