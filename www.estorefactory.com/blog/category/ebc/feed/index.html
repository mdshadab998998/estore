<h2>What is Amazon Climate Pledge Friendly?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68370" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2.jpg" alt="What is Amazon Climate Pledge Friendly?" width="1140" height="640" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-2-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>Climate Pledge Friendly is a green initiative designed to make it easier for shoppers to discover and shop for sustainable products on Amazon. Brands selling eco-friendly products can boast the Climate Pledge Friendly label on their listings to inform consumers. The retail giant has also created a dedicated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21398287011" rel="nofollow">store page</a> allowing shoppers to browse through various categories and shop for products with the green label.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68373" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="640" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>

<p>The label already appears on more than 25000 listings and is clearly visible eight below the title and rating stars. Climate Friendly selection of products are found across grocery, household, fashion, beauty, and personal electronics products, as well as items from a range of other categories—from brands including Seventh Generation, Burt’s Bees Baby, Honest Company, and HP Inc.</p>
<p>Note that Amazon gives this badge to products and not brand as a whole. So even one or two of your products may still be eligible for the badge while others are not.</p>
<h2>Why does getting the badge matter so much?</h2>
<p>The Climate Pledge Friendly initiative supports Amazon’s commitment to building a sustainable business for its shoppers and the planet. “Climate Pledge Friendly is a simple way for customers to discover more sustainable products that help preserve the natural world,” said Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. By launching Climate Pledge Friendly wants to reach the Paris Agreement (a legally binding international treaty on climate change) 10 years early and be <a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/?energyType=true&amp;workerCount=true&amp;engagementProgram=true&amp;productCategory=true" rel="nofollow">net-zero carbon by the year 2040</a>. This program will make it easier for the shoppers to make sustainable purchases and eventually, Amazon will be able to align with its commitment to a sustainable future.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68372" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="640" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-1-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p>So it won’t be a surprise if Amazon favors the products having a Climate Pledge Friendly badge over those who don’t. In the example below, you can see a dedicated Climate Pledge Friendly module in the search result page when a shopper is looking for “organic shampoo,” and qualifying products are labeled within search results.</p>
<h3><strong>For many categories, the SERP looks like this:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Row 1:</strong> <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon Sponsored Ads</a><br />
<strong>Row 2:</strong> Top 4 organic ranking products<br />
<strong>Row 3:</strong> <strong>Climate Pledge Friendly products</strong><br />
<strong>Row 4:</strong> Editorial recommendations<br />
<strong>Row 5:</strong> More organic products</p>
<p>This is why you should not miss getting this badge if your product is eligible. Not only will you be able to get an edge over your competitors by being the greener option, but Amazon will also prioritize and favor your organic rankings. Besides, you will also bring in front of more eyeballs by getting featured in Amazon’s very own storefront.</p>
<h3>TL;DR?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Climate-Friendly badge is prominently displayed on the search result pages and the product detail page</li>
<li>Eligible products get prime placement on page #1</li>
<li>Your products can get featured on Amazon’s dedicated storefront for the program</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get the badge?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68373" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="640" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-2-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>

<p>Alongside, Amazon has also launched its own sustainability certification called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=21221609011" rel="nofollow">Compact By Design</a>, an initiative aimed to identify products that are designed efficiently and require less packaging, ultimately reducing the carbon footprint. The products will not necessarily look different, but with the removal of excess air and water, they become easier to ship. To qualify for Compact by Design, products must have best-in-class “unit efficiency.” To calculate the unit efficiency of a product, Amazon uses various attributes such as package dimensions, item weight, and the number of units.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-68375" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="640" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2.jpg 1140w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2-800x449.jpg 800w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1140px) 100vw, 1140px" /></p>
<p><strong>Compact by Design Unit Efficiency formula (Image reference: Amazon)</strong></p>
<p>To certify for Compact by Design, a product must have a qualifying unit efficiency, be in an eligible category and be enrolled in the Amazon Brand Registry program.</p>
<p><strong>Step by step instruction:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>View all the websites to identify the certifications you can get.</li>
<li>Gather all the documents and take the necessary steps to get the certifications from any one of them. You can learn more about the certifications and the requirements on their website.</li>
<li>Once you receive the certificate, make sure the information is updated in your listing</li>
<li>The badge should appear automatically and if it doesn’t, contact seller support and submit all the documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Getting the badge is easier said than done. The application process demands the time you don’t have. Partnering with an <a title="Amazon Account Management" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seller-account-management/"><strong>Amazon Account Management</strong></a> agency can make the process smoother.</p>
<h2>It’s the era of climate change. Being sustainable won’t be an option then</h2>
<p>Amazon’s efforts to become greener are robust and ongoing. It is likely that Amazon will continue to favor the products that align with its goal of making sustainable living commonplace. The benefits aren’t short-term either. This means that early enrollment into this program can be extremely rewarding. But positioning yourself as a “green brand” takes more than just getting the badge. Your images, copy, <strong><a title="Amazon Enhanced Brand Content" href="https://www.estorefactory.com.au/enhance-brand-content/">Amazon Enhanced Brand Content</a></strong> and all the assets should scream sustainable.</p>
<p>Brands hoping to make the most of this program can always partner with <a title="Amazon Consultants" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/"><strong>Amazon consultants</strong></a> from eStore Factory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Amazon A Plus Content are no more an interesting, new feature; they are a necessity.</em></p>
<p>It’s no secret that Amazon is favoring brands more than ever. 90% of the recent updates rolled out by the e-commerce mogul are for the brand–registered sellers. Establishing a brand shoppers’ trust won’t just help you get some special treatment from Amazon but also help you get the edge you were looking for. One of the most compelling features to do this is by creating Amazon branded content. In this article, we’ll go over:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon A+ page</li>
<li>What is Amazon A+ Page?</li>
<li>The Dos&#8217; &amp; Don&#8217;ts</li>
<li>Top 10 Amazon Enhanced Brand Content examples</li>
<li>Tips for creating best Amazon Enhanced Brand Content</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6 Reasons to give Amazon A Plus Content a try:</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23897" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-3.jpg" alt="best a+ content on amazon" width="1456" height="450" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-3.jpg 1456w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-3-300x93.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-3-1024x316.jpg 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-3-768x237.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-3-600x185.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1456px) 100vw, 1456px" /></p>
<h3>Reason #1: Give your product a much-needed conversion boost (up to 10%)</h3>
<p>According to a study conducted by Amazon, when made correctly, <strong><a title="Amazon Enhanced Brand Content" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/">Amazon Enhanced Brand Content</a></strong> can increase your conversion by 3-10%. While the average increase in conversion is 5-6%. Now that&#8217;s big! Products with best A+ Content convert better than those with don&#8217;t because of a single reason. Customers are fed with the information they need to make a purchase. As a result, they don&#8217;t find the need to wander and find a better product.</p>
<h3>Reason #2: Because title, bullets and images are not enough, they never are!</h3>
<p>The more, the merrier. As shoppers are not physically present, every shot of the product and every little information takes them closer to a confident purchase. Plus, you can&#8217;t add a lot of information in your bullet points, or they look text-y and the description is barely 2000 characters with spaces and HTML. On the top of that, the stringent rules for <a title="Amazon Infographic Images" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-photo-editing-services/">Amazon infographic images</a> leaves less room for creativity. While with <strong>enhanced content Amazon, you can give wings to your imagination and let your product be the star of the show</strong> (with, of course, a tiny list of content rules and regulations.)</p>
<h3>Reason #3: Prevent your product detail page from looking like a <em>software agreement:</em></h3>
<p>No one wants to read the boring text! Would you like to read this?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23899" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2.png" alt="best amazon ebc examples" width="1342" height="366" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2.png 1342w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-300x82.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-1024x279.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-768x209.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-600x164.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1342px) 100vw, 1342px" /></p>
<p>Or rather this &#8211;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23900" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-2-scaled.jpg" alt="best amazon a+ content examples" width="999" height="2560" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-2-scaled.jpg 999w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-2-117x300.jpg 117w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-2-400x1024.jpg 400w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-2-768x1967.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-2-600x1537.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for this point. No more further discussion.</p>
<h3>Reason #4: Help your shoppers to &#8220;stay&#8221; on the product detail page</h3>
<p>You might think the bringing the shoppers on the product detail page is the most challenging task ever. But least did you know that the battle has just begun! These days Amazon is increasingly inclining towards sponsored results to the extent that it is replacing organic product suggestions on the product detail page with sponsored ads. Take a look at the example below. Right after the bullet points, you can see &#8220;Brands related to this category on Amazon&#8221; section clicking on which will take the shoppers directly at the sponsored storefront. If that wasn&#8217;t enough, there are two more sections, sponsored obviously, named &#8220;Sponsored products related to this item&#8221; and &#8220;4 stars and above&#8221;. Phew! Seems like the product detail page has more competition than the search result pages. <strong>So it is absolutely necessary that it stands out and Amazon A+ Content is built exactly for that</strong>.</p>

<h3>Reason #5: Tell why your brand is great</h3>
<p>Cliché but true. Brand story works wonders on convincing a buyer. Would like to buy from a brand where a Mexican mother sells handcrafted sauces for all the families in the U.S. and the sauces are made without anything preservatives or from an anonymous brand you don&#8217;t know about. The answer is pretty obvious. <strong>As humans, we connect to the story because it triggers a biological response. A+ Content can be your little corner to highlight how your brand was created and why customers should trust you.</strong></p>
<h3>Reason #6: Cross-selling opportunities</h3>
<p>The comparison module on your product detail page allows you to showcase the various features of the cousin products of your catalog and opens up the chance of cross-selling. <strong>When the customer clicks on the product shown on the module, they will be redirected to the respective product detail page.</strong> I am so amazed when sellers create an A+ Page and don&#8217;t agree to add a comparison module. That&#8217;s an essential thing! <strong>You can advertise your product for completely free.</strong> You can add color variations, flavors, or even completely unrelated product, doesn&#8217;t matter! What matters is that you are helping the other listings of your catalog grow.</p>

<h3>Reason #7: Best Amazon A+ Pages can help you woo the shoppers before you get social proof:</h3>
<p>Reviews and conversion/sales are like the centuries-long dilemma of chicken and egg. You need a strong base of reviews for sale and a good amount of sales for reviews. So what helps what? Turns out that if your listing is just launched and you don’t have any reviews then best Amazon A+ Content can help your shoppers trust you as a brand.</p>
<h2>Back to basics:</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re convinced on creating an A+ Page for your product detail page, let us refresh your knowledge of A+ Pages.</p>
<h3>What is A+ Content?</h3>
<p>Formerly known as <a href="https://www.amazonebcservices.com/">Enhanced Brand Content</a>, Amazon A+ Content lets Amazon sellers and vendors spruce up their HTML product description with lifelike images, hero banners, crisp text placements and comparison modules.</p>
<h3>Who is eligible:</h3>
<p>All the sellers with brand registry 2.0 can create A+ Pages.</p>
<h3>Is there a fee?</h3>
<p>At present A+ Content is available free to the eligible sellers. Make sure to take advantage of it before Amazon monetizes it.</p>
<h3>Is A+ Content indexed?</h3>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t; still, it would be a good practice to try and keep some text out of the images. However, your description will be indexed from the backend.</p>
<p><strong>Know more about <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/benefits-of-adding-enhanced-brand-content-ebc-to-your-amazon-listings/">A+ Pages</a> here:</strong></p>
<h2>It&#8217;s Amazon; they have rules for everything</h2>
<p>Amazon has a very stringent policy when it comes to A+ Pages. There are some things you can do and a lot you can&#8217;t do. Most of them are apparent like make sure the text in the images are readable and images shouldn&#8217;t be blur so I won&#8217;t bore you with things you already know. Below I have listed the not-so-obvious don&#8217;ts of the creating best Amazon EBC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t write words such as: cheapest, free, best, affordable price, environment friendly, certificate, awards, buy now, FDA approved, customer satisfaction, recommended by, certified, tested, approved, proven, validated</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t add any icons or symbols that reflect the above words</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t add copyright, trademark, or registered symbols. Remove any such symbols from your logo as well</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t write editorial or 3rd party quotes from external sources such as magazines and television shows.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t write shipping information or anything related</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t make any mention of guarantee and warranty information</li>
</ul>
<p>It is ironic that even being so rigid for following these rules, Amazon chooses to favor some of the buyers by letting them write whatever they want. Take a look at the example below. The brand has broken three rules in just one banner. They have made claims for customer satisfaction and for being the #1 American brand. The A+ Page is still live and thriving. This is just one and there are so many other such instances. Although you don&#8217;t have any other option but to follow the rules, in the end, it completely depends on the person or the system who reviews the A+ Page. Good luck!</p>

<h2>Tips for creating best A+ Content on Amazon:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t make your A+ Page text-heavy. Extra-long paragraphs, confusing language, unknown abbreviations can distract the customer, so it&#8217;s better to cut the clutter and keep it short and to the point.</li>
<li>Always add alt-tag keywords. These won&#8217;t be indexed by Amazon but are indexed by Google and are also used for screen reader applications for visually impaired shoppers.</li>
<li>Either click great lifestyle images or create realistic lifestyle composite images. In short, images are the life and soul of your A+ Page; they need to be the best.</li>
<li>Scroll down your listing, read the common customer questions, read why you&#8217;ve got negative reviews and try to answer/resolve them in your A+ Content.</li>
<li>You might have to edit your bullet points after creating A+ Page. There are a few things we can&#8217;t add in A+ Page. For example, if you have warranty guarantee information in your description and you don&#8217;t have it in your bullet points, then you should be editing the bullet points as well. You can always take help of our <a title="Amazon listing optimization services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-product-listing-optimization/">Amazon listing optimization services</a> for that.</li>
<li>Check for mobile. About 150 million customers shopped from mobile apps in 2019, so make sure the A+ Content looks just as larger-than-life on mobile as it does on desktops. Luckily Amazon allows you to preview your A+ Page for mobile while you upload the content so you can eliminate the guesswork. The A+ Content Examples we have listed are all mobile friendly.</li>
<li>It all works in synergy. The specialized product description works best for increasing the conversion of your best-selling ASINs. It&#8217;s not a quick fix for your slow-moving inventory. But if you are launching a new product, best Amazon A+ Pages combined with <a title="Amazon PPC Optimization" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/">Amazon PPC optimization</a> can help you get a boost. Plus, A+ Pages are one of the most important elements to make your page retail-ready.</li>
<li>A/B test and see what works best. Learn more about A/B testing of A+ Content <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/blog/ab-testing-in-aplus-now/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Although Amazon advertises A+ Page as a self-service tool, it is not.</h2>
<p>There are many things you need to take care of, rules to follow and the main thing, not every one of us is a designer. You need expert guidance and creativity, or the A+ Page might end up reducing the conversion. Investing in <a title="Amazon EBC Services" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/">Amazon EBC Services</a> from a reputed firm like eStore Factory can give you long-term dividends in the form of increased conversion, sales and ranking. What are you waiting for? Contact our <a title="Amazon Consultants" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">Amazon consultants</a> and make the most of the not-so-attractive description space available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brands using <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/">A+ Content to boost their conversion rates</a> try to master it by using the best copy, images and modules. But without being able to compare the data, how can they know if they have got the best possible page to drive maximum results? Well, the wait is finally over with the introduction of the new tool: Manage Your Experiments.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4948" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.gif" alt="Manage Your A+ Experiments" width="346" height="200" data-wp-editing="1" /></p>
<h2>MANAGE YOUR EXPERIMENTS: THE WHAT, WHEN &amp; WHY</h2>
<p><strong>What:</strong> “Manage Your Experiments” allows sellers and vendors to A/B test their A+ Pages so they can compare two pieces of content and determine which one provides better results. In a layman’s language, you upload two A+ Pages (for the same ASIN) at once and Amazon will randomly show each of the pages to different customers visiting your detail page. At the end of the experiment, Amazon will provide results and data as to which A+ Page performed better.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> This new beta feature was launched by the retail giant in October 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> Amazon is leaving no stone unturned to enhance the customer experience. It is finally playing nicer to the brands by divulging the valuable data it has. According to Amazon, “Experiments can help you statistically find the best A+ content for your listings, improve future content, and help drive more sales.” This new tool will help the brands accelerate their conversion rate and improve shopper’s buying experience.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4950" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1.jpg" alt="amazon enhanced brand content design" width="1410" height="475" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1.jpg 1410w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-600x202.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-300x101.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-768x259.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-1024x345.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1410px) 100vw, 1410px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>Step #1: Check If You Are Eligible</strong></span></p>
<p>Not every seller is eligible for MYE. You will have to check the eligibility criteria first. According to Amazon, to run A/B testing through MYE, you must be a selling partner that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Owns a brand registered with Brand Registry</li>
<li>Has very high traffic ASINs</li>
<li>Has published A+ Content on those ASINs</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not meet any of these criteria, then you will receive a message in Seller Or Vendor Central that looks something like this.</p>
<p>If you want to check your eligibility, <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/experiments/dashboard" rel="nofollow">click here</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4957" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.png" alt="amazon enhanced brand content" width="1226" height="296" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3.png 1226w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-600x145.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-300x72.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-768x185.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-1024x247.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1226px) 100vw, 1226px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>Step #2: Select The ASINs For Which You Want To Run A/B Testing</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are able to view the MYE dashboard, then we are ready to move ahead. Regardless if you are viewing in Seller Central or Vendor Central, the MYE dashboard will look similar. Click on “Create a New Experiment” to see which of your ASINs are eligible for the experiment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4958" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4.png" alt="Select The ASINs For Which You Want To Run A/B Testing" width="1228" height="484" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4.png 1228w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4-600x236.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4-300x118.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4-768x303.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4-1024x404.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1228px) 100vw, 1228px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>Step #3: Create Two Different Versions Of Your A+ Page For The Same ASINs</strong></span><br />
Once you select click “Select” on the ASIN you choose, you will be taken to the next section, where you will have to choose two different versions of the same A+ Content.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4959" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5.png" alt="amazon a plus content" width="1240" height="413" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5.png 1240w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-600x200.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-300x100.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-768x256.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-1024x341.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px" /></p>
<p>Here, you will also have to give careful thought to the variables you want to test for. Decide the variables which significantly impact the click and conversion rates of your A+ Content. Once you are confident with both the versions of the A+ Content, submit them for approval. Approval can take up to 2-7 days (but it usually happens within 48 hours).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4960" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/6.png" alt="enhanced content amazon" width="1390" height="583" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/6.png 1390w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/6-600x252.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/6-300x126.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/6-768x322.png 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/6-1024x429.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1390px) 100vw, 1390px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>Step #4: Set Up &amp; Run A/B Test</strong></span></p>
<p>Now you need to schedule the test for a suitable duration. Currently, Amazon is offering a test duration of 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks. You can choose the duration that is in line with your goals.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4961" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7.png" alt="best amazon enhanced brand content" width="985" height="422" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7.png 985w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-600x257.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-300x129.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7-768x329.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px" /></p>
<p>Once your experiment is live, each customer who visits your product detail page will be randomly assigned an A+ Content version. Please note that logged in customers will see the same variation every time they visit the product detail page. While your experiment is running, you can change the duration or cancel the experiment anytime (I would highly recommend against the latter). You can also edit your A+ Contents while experiments are in progress.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>Step #5: Measure The Results</strong></span></p>
<p>Amazon will start sharing data and analytics a few days after the test is running and it will send you a detailed performance report after the experiment has ended. Amazon updates the experiment results once a week until it ends. After your experiment is completed, you will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation on which A+ Content variation is more effective</li>
<li>How confident you should be in the recommendation</li>
<li>The confidence interval of likely outcomes from that content</li>
<li>The estimated 12-month impact on sales</li>
</ul>
<p>These performance insights can help you choose the most effective content for your product detail page, which in the end will help you to boost conversion rates and sales.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>Step #6: Rinse &amp; Repeat</strong></span></p>
<p>Clearly, A/B testing is not a one-time thing. You should continue to use MYE and optimize your A+ Content until you have crafted the most optimal content for your brand. Also, you can use learning from one set of ASINs to fine-tune the strategies for other ASINs.</p>
<h2>AMAZON A+ CONTENT VARIABLE YOU CAN TEST:</h2>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>#1: Product Imagery</strong></span></p>
<p>You can either use product images that highlight the different features of the product or lifestyle images that show product-in-use. You can evaluate what type images customer likes better – product-focused infographics, lifestyle, or a combination of both.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4951" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8-1.jpg" alt="best amazon a+ pages" width="2693" height="550" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>#2: Adding Brand Logo</strong></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4962" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9.png" alt="best amazon a+ content" width="838" height="904" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9.png 838w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-600x647.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-278x300.png 278w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-768x828.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></p>
<p>Brand logo is usually recommended because it helps in spreading brand awareness and increases customer trust. If you do not already have a brand logo, I would suggest adding one on your A+ page.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>#3: Headlines &amp; Text Changes</strong></span></p>
<p>Who says no one reads text? There is a category of online shoppers who read each and every word you write. And most of the shoppers will surely take a look at the head points and the taglines you write. Headlines reel people in. Cut the crap and try writing engaging headlines to motivate customers to read more about the product.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4952" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10-1.jpg" alt="best a+ content on amazon" width="1000" height="310" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10-1-600x186.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10-1-300x93.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10-1-768x238.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>#4: Adding A Comparison Chart</strong></span></p>
<p>Comparison charts are a great way to showcase the features of your product and adding links to other products from your catalog. This helps in cross-selling and increases the sales of your other products as well. You can add a comparison chart to your A+ Page and examine the results.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4963" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11.png" alt="amazon enhanced brand content" width="978" height="632" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11.png 978w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11-600x388.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11-300x194.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/11-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>#5: Using New A+ Content Modules</strong></span></p>
<p>There are a few A+ Content modules that are used repeatedly by everyone. You will find these modules in every other A+ Page. You can take a look at them below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4953" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/12.jpg" alt="a+ premium content amazon" width="1000" height="549" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/12.jpg 1000w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/12-600x329.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/12-300x165.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/12-768x422.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Now there are some untapped modules that are equally effective but not used by everyone. Here are a few.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4954" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/13.jpg" alt="amazon a+ premium content" width="1000" height="559" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/13.jpg 1000w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/13-600x335.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/13-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/13-768x429.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>You can use any of these modules in your A+ Content and examine the reaction of the customers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2e6799; font-size: medium;"><strong>#6: Changing The Layouts</strong></span></p>
<p>The position of your images, text and the overall layout affects the look and feel as well as the scannability of your A+ Content. Try to change the sequence of modules, swap a few images, add or remove some modules and see how it works compared to your existing A+ Page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4955" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14.jpg" alt="premium a+ content amazon" width="681" height="570" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14.jpg 681w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14-600x502.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /></p>
<h2>INTERPRETING THE RESULTS:</h2>
<p>After the experiment is completed, you can view the results and see which content has driven more sales. Results are updated every week so you can get a sneak peek of the experiment soon. The results tend to be cumulative and focus on units sold.</p>
<p>Amazon takes into consideration that data and decides which version they think is the winner. For example, one of the versions could have an 80% confidence rate, which means that Amazon is 80% confident that the selected version of A+ Content will bring better results. You can take a look at the Experiments Results help section to get finer details.</p>
<h2>GET THE BEST OUT OF YOUR EXPERIMENTS:</h2>
<p>Here are some of the best practices you should follow when it comes to testing your A+ Content through MYE feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiment on high traffic ASINs. The larger the sample size, the better you can evaluate your results.</li>
<li>Make major changes in the A+ Pages; minor changes will not bring visible results.</li>
<li>Make one big change at a time. If you make changes in too many variables at once, you won’t be able to know what worked and what did not.</li>
<li>To make sure your results are accurate, run your test for a longer period of time.</li>
<li>Don’t stop the test in between, even if you feel the result is obvious.</li>
<li>Apply the same set of ASINs to both the A+ pages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SHOULD I USE MYE FEATURE?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4956" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/15.jpg" alt="amazon a+ premium" width="1295" height="108" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/15.jpg 1295w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/15-600x50.jpg 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/15-300x25.jpg 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/15-768x64.jpg 768w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/15-1024x85.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1295px) 100vw, 1295px" /></p>
<p>A/B testing has always been the most favorite tool for digital marketers because it allows them to test content strategies with real audiences and not focus groups. Testing your content before actually launching it increases the chances of your success trifold. Before MYE was introduced, sellers had to test the versions of A+ Content by uploading and testing them individually, one after the other. This process could take months and the results would still be unreliable because of the changing factors like seasonality, trends, prices, etc.</p>
<p>MYE, on the other hand, makes it possible for the sellers to test both the versions of their A+ Content at the same time and evaluate their performance within just weeks. And the data is 100% reliable because it&#8217;s extracted by Amazon itself.</p>
<p>The best part? This tool is free at present. So better try it out before Amazon monetizes it as well.</p>
<h2>OPEN THE DOOR TO DATA</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4949" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/16.gif" alt="amazon premium a+ content" width="220" height="220" /></p>
<p>If you are eligible, I would highly recommend you to use this tool. You have got nothing to lose and you will gain valuable data that will help you improve the performance of your listing. What more could you have asked for?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being customer-centric, Amazon has constantly been making efforts to ease the buying process of the customers. In its efforts, the retail giant has realized that in this age of sizzle videos and HD images, engaging content appeals to shoppers more than anything else. Content tools like Storefront, Posts, A+ Content, and A++ Content (also known as Amazon Premium A+ Content) enhance the buying experience and make it easy for the customers to scan the listing. Amazon A Plus Pages &amp; EBC &amp; are more or less the same but Amazon A+ Premium Content is a revamped version with some uber-cool and souped-up interactive features.</span></p>
<h2><u>What is Amazon Premium A+ Content?</u></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="Amazon Premium A+ Content" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Premium A+ Content</a>, also known as A++ Content is similar to basic Amazon A+ Content in general idea and placement but high in superior imagery, HD videos, and interactive features. It was first introduced in 2016 and was available to only some of the huge brands like Dove, Sony, Bose, Ghostbed and a few more.</span></p>
<h2><u>How many modules are there in Amazon A+ Premium Content?</u></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a total of 16 interactive modules in Amazon A++ Content out of which vendors can use any of the 7 modules for each product page. The text takes a backseat in <strong>Amazon A+ Premium Content</strong> because the maximum of modules focuses on images. The full-size images stretch across the page and appear more ad-like. The typical size for images is 800 x 600 or 1464 x 600. Detailed information about the most popular A+ Premium Content modules are mentioned below:</span></p>
<h3>Video:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This module allows Vendors to include HD video related to their product. Videos can be expanded to full screen to provide a life-like and theatre-like experience to the customers. HD videos open up many creative and strategic options which can be used to increase the conversion rates. A short one minute video allows the Vendors to showcase all the standout features of the product.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15923" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-1-1.png" alt="Video Loops" width="1312" height="540" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-1-1.png 1312w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-1-1-600x247.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-1-1-300x123.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-1-1-1024x421.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-1-1-768x316.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1312px) 100vw, 1312px" /></p>
<h3>Video Loops:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video loop is an informative video that constantly repeats whenever a customer views the listing. It allows the customers to learn more about your product and motivates them to directly click on the Add to Cart button.</span></p>
<h3>Fast Add To Cart Option:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Add to Cart allows the customer a fast and easy option to add related products to their cart. It is an effective and efficient way to promote other similar products from your catalog.</span></p>
<h3>Testimonials:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This totally new interactive feature gives Vendors the opportunity to showcase customer reviews.

<h2>Is A++ Content mobile friendly?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like <strong>Enhanced Brand Content</strong>, A+ Premium Content Amazon is mobile friendly. Most standard A++ modules look great and function perfectly on mobile devices. Amazon scales the images and re-organizes the content so that it can fit smoothly on small screen. Moreover, A++ content is displayed above the sponsored product carousel, which reduces clicks on competitor’s ads.</span></p>
<h2>What is the cost for Amazon Premium A+ Content?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A+ Content is an exclusive program which is only open for some of Amazon’s most strategic Vendors so naturally, it is priced as such. Amazon A Content cost varies from $250K to $500K. In addition to fees charged by Amazon, you may have to incur some additional costs for clicking robust imagery, designing work and content creation.</span></p>
<h2>What is the difference between Enhanced Brand Content, A+ Content, and A++ Content?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic differences between Enhanced Brand Content, A+ Content, and A++ Content are described below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<style>
      table,<br />
      th,<br />
      td {<br />

<h2>Is A++ Content Worth The Price Tag?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many exciting features at hand, A++ Content can help sellers give a dynamic view of the product. The comprehensive comparison charts, in the box option and FAQs, make the product self-explanatory while fast add to cart and subscribe and save option makes A++ Content extremely user-friendly. If created the right way, it can also increase the conversion rate for up to 15%. Moreover, it helps accelerate brand awareness and makes your presence felt amongst the pool of competitors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the price paid for getting these benefits is a bit too much. Apart from the fees paid to Amazon, the creation of A++ Content requires lots of resources, excellent visual assets, and a thorough designing knowledge. So, before taking a plunge and pulling your assets together, it will be wise to do a thorough analysis of your product niche and weigh down all the pros and cons.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon keeps evolving out new ways to not only enhance the professionalism and readability of your page but also keeps on adding more seller services to keep you a leg up on your competition which benefits to improve the shopping experience for your customers as well.</p>
<p>With the old <strong><a title="Enhance Brand Content" href="https://www.amazonebcservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhance Brand Content</a></strong>, Amazon used to offer five different EBC templates to choose from. The options looked like this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-667" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-1.png" alt="EBC Modular Templates" width="768" height="155" /></p>
<p>In August 2018, Amazon launched new EBC content template. These new Enhanced Brand Content templates provide more options than to display your product to customers. They enable a boost for sellers and offer them more versatile and accommodating templates that provide a large selection of design modules.</p>
<p>The new Amazon Enhanced Brand Content template consists of 5 predefined and 1 custom templates.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-668" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Image-2.png" alt="Amazon A+ Content templates" width="609" height="485" /></p>
<h3>Jump Right In with Amazon&#8217;s New Predefined Templates</h3>
<p>The predefined  Amazon Enhanced Brand Content templates provide a design with certain EBC modules already included and ready-and-waiting for content. Each template starts with a brand logo module and product description module at the top that cannot be removed or rearranged. The predefined EBC Amazon templates are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rose:</strong> Brand logo, product description, 2 header images, product features</li>
<li><strong>Tulip:</strong> Brand logo, product description, header image, product features</li>
<li><strong>Orchid:</strong> Brand logo, product description, header image, product features</li>
<li><strong>Sunflower:</strong> Brand logo, product description, 2 header images, product features</li>
<li><strong>Lilly:</strong> Brand logo, product description, header image, product features, header image</li>
</ul>
<p>Although predefined, they are completely customizable. Modules can be added or removed to enhance the storytelling of brands. To add, move, number or delete a module, use the controls to the right of each module.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-3.jpg" alt="Amazon EBC modules " width="384" height="348" /></p>
<p>The predefined Amazon EBC templates are best for sellers who want to work quickly or who want to establish a consistent theme to apply to multiple products within their brand.</p>
<p>A custom template can be used by sellers who want to create the EBC and add image and text placement as per their choice.</p>
<h3>Benefits of the new Amazon A+ Content templates:</h3>
<ul>
<li> New Amazon EBC templates are very mobile friendly. Before only one of the modules was available on your phone, now more of them are. As a high percentage of buyers use their phones to make purchases, so using these new templates will allow mobile users to get more idea of the product.</li>
<li>&#8220;Drag and drop&#8221; feature of the new platform makes it easier to transfer your high-resolution photos.</li>
<li>More EBC layout options provide more room to be creative to sellers.</li>
<li>In New “Custom Template” you can mix and match Amazon EBC modules to personally customize your page and guarantee a smoother flow.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a revitalized approach to <strong><a title="Amazon EBC Service" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EBC Service</a></strong>, Amazon’s new templates, EBC Amazon theme and their modules, are worth refreshing on some of the standard guidelines and restrictions that still apply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">In the fourth quarter of 2016, Amazon unveiled a brand new feature to help sellers enhance their product pages with the use of enticing images, formatted bullet points, crisp text placements, headers, videos and more. But with ever increasing competition, Enhanced Brand Content has become a more of a necessity than just an exciting Amazon feature.</p>
<p>People are getting busy and lazy, so you hardly have a few seconds to compel the visitor to make a purchase. Humans being visually wired creatures, illustrating the aspects and key features in a graphical way can connect more effectively because everyone prefers quickly scanning the beautifully crafted images rather than reading unformulated and never-ending texts. If created in the right way, EBC can majorly contribute in engaging and educating the audience, leading to a stronger conversion rate.</p>
<p><strong><u>What is Amazon EBC?</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><a title="Amazon Enhanced Brand Content" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-a-plus-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Enhanced Brand Content</a></strong> is a Trademark brand owner exclusive service which allows modifying the product description of the branded ASINs with the use of enhanced images and text. Now sellers can customize their product description with attractive EBC features instead of writing a simple text paragraph.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Example of EBC</strong></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-600" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/amazon-enhanced-brand-content-1-208x300.jpg" alt="amazon-enhanced-brand-content-1" width="208" height="300" /></p>
<p>When buyers are fed with the information they need to make a purchase, conversion rates will increase and return rate will decline. Statistics have shown that the addition of <a href="https://www.estorefactory.co.uk/a-plus-enhance-brand-content/">EBC</a> to your detail page has quoted a sales rise of about 3% to 10%.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Five reasons to invest in Amazon EBC:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Showcase your Brand Assets:</strong></span> There is a reason why some brand resonates with the customers while others are simply ignored. According to a study, modern customers want to know who are they buying from and they want a figure or a picture that can match with their perception of your brand. Communicating your brand story can not only help build a loyal customer base but can also increase the social engagement for up to 30%.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Free of Cost (For Now): </strong></span>You can’t beat the cost of EBC because; at present the retail giant is offering it at an exclusive price of 0$. This tool is kept at a promotional period which is why there is no cost as of now. So, even if you need to outsource the designing and writing work, the return on investments is sure to pay off. This is one of the potent reasons to invest in <a title="Amazon Enhanced Brand Content" href="https://www.amazonebcservices.com/">Amazon Enhanced Brand Content</a>. But make sure you take advantage of this service sooner than soon because as the Amazon charges for every other thing, it might for EBC as well.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Inclusion of Short Video:</strong></span> The ability to add videos showing the product-in-use is a can’t miss opportunity for a seller to capitalize on. Online buyers eat up the visual content and products pages having them are sure to get an unfair advantage over the others because buyers would rather watch a one-minute video rather than read about it. When portrayed in the right way, they give shoppers an in-store shopping experience.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Optimize the Images:</strong></span> Alt tags is the best place to add some obscure terms with low search volume that were left out of your backend search terms fields. They won’t show up on the front end but will optimize the chances of your product being found via search. The main aim is to improve the shopping experience of the visually impaired; the screen reader application such as Alexa will read them out loud to the shoppers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Crisp &amp; Formatted Text Placements:</strong></span> With only a few HTML tags at hand, you have almost no room for much flexibility or creativity to try something unique on your old FBA description. Infusing your page with rich content allows you to deliver information quickly as well as make the listing more scannable, which appeals both product skimmers and intelligent buyers. According to a survey, rich media content can increase your conversion rate by a whopping 3 to 6 times, compared to plain text.</p>
<p>If you are still in a dilemma if it’s worth the extra time, money and effort, then the answer is simply yes. It’s definitely worth it. If you want the advantages of EBC without the hassle of designing, layout and submission, then consider using <strong><a title="Amazon EBC Services" href="https://www.amazonebcservices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EBC Services</a> </strong>from a reputed firm like <strong><a title="eStore Factory" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/">eStore Factory</a></strong>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amazon Brand Pages or simply Amazon Pages refers to the <a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-marketing-services/" title="Amazon Marketing Services">Amazon Marketing Services</a> (AMS) advertising facility allowing brands to create a customized page for the purpose of generating more views and sales on the Amazon Marketplace. It also helps the brand appear on top of the products list.</p>
<p>With the incessant cutthroat competitions among various brands on Amazon, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the sellers to get proper traffic and visibility. Hence, the facility of Amazon brand pages is just apt for that purpose.</p>
<h3>Benefits of creating brand page on Amazon</h3>
<ol>
<li>Give full details about your product and brands in such a way that it instantly connects to the users and online shoppers. You can optimize the page using high-quality lifestyle images, designs and content.</li>
<li>Try to add additional information and selling points on your Amazon page for easier communication with the users.</li>
<li>You can create Amazon Brand Page in the similar way as you create your own website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Amazon page can include banners and link to your social media profile for direct communication with your fans and potential customers. There is one more advantage for the user, “<strong><em>Amazon Analytics</em></strong>”. This feature allows the vendors to get detailed information about how their products are performing on Amazon.</p>
<h3>How to Optimize Your Amazon A Pages?</h3>
<ol>
<li>The content should conform to Amazon’s General Creative Guidelines and must not contradict with their policies.</li>
<li>Your brand page should have the links that overall cover all the items and product categories of an <a title="e commerce service provider" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e commerce service provider</a>.</li>
<li>Do not capitalize the content. It will not click with the online customers. Use full capital word only where it is indispensable to do so.</li>
<li>Properly formatted and high-quality images or pictures should be inserted with your content on the Amazon brand page.</li>
<li>No promotional messages or price information should be given on the Amazon page.</li>
<li>The layout should be simple and succinct. Utilize the white space as much as possible.</li>
<li>If a product is to be featured within the creative section then images should be kept uncropped and tidy. Photos instantly attract the customers to engage with the page and product. The Amazon-branded icons, logos and star cannot be used on the page.</li>
<li>Page metrics tool might be needed to measure your success and visibility on <strong><em>Amazon product list</em></strong> page.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The first priority of an online retailer is to let his products become visible on Amazon website. Then he has to customize and create best Amazon brand pages in such a way that his products appear on the top of the Amazon’s search list. You can also use a product widget at the bottom of the Amazon page.</p>
<p>Customers surf the online stores depending upon the products that they will buy. Amazon brand page gives maximum visibility to the online sellers. Use the best seller widget to know which of your products are being sold on the website in maximum number.</p>
<p>If you are serious about getting more visibility and traffic on your Amazon page then you should consult the <strong><em><a href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-seo-ppc-services/" title="Amazon SEO Experts">Amazon SEO Specialist</a></em></strong> of the company <strong><em>eStore Factory</em></strong> today.
