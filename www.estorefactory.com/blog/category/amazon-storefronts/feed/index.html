<h2>Amazon Storefront Best Practices:</h2>
<p>Here are some of the tips which can help you create a better, more engaging, and converting storefront on Amazon.</p>
<h3>1) Create Individual Category Pages</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14789" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1.png" alt="set up amazon storefront" width="1349" height="364" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1.png 1349w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-600x162.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-300x81.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-1024x276.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4-1-768x207.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px" /><br />
Organizing your product according to individual categories makes it easier for shoppers to find the product they are looking for. Simply creating a banner for the homepage and adding a product grid won’t help you earn more sales. But making your customer’s buying experience easier would definitely help you do so. You can categorize your ASINs according to the type of product or according to the shoppers. For example, if you are selling apparel, you might want to create different pages for Men, Women, and Kids. And inside those pages, you can showcase the products according to the type, for example, hoodies, t-shirts, formal wear, etc. If you have an extra-large product catalog, it might look very tedious and time-consuming, but trust me; this is the most crucial step to creating a storefront.</p>
<h3>2) Don’t Forget To Add A Video If You Have One</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14790" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1.png" alt="make an amazon storefront" width="1062" height="499" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1.png 1062w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1-600x282.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1-300x141.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1-1024x481.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-1-768x361.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" /></p>
<p>Amazon is inspiring sellers to capitalize more and more on videos. Previously they could only be added to A++ Pages/Premium A+ Content, but now any seller with a brand registry can add videos in their listing image section and a selected group of sellers can now also add videos in their Sponsored Brand Ads. Videos attract instant attention, make your brand look professional and drive more traffic and conversion than images, which is why it is essential that you upload a video in your storefront too. If you don’t have a video yet, it won’t be a bad decision to spend some money on making one.</p>
<h3>3) Include An About Us/Lifetime Guarantee Section</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14791" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1.png" alt="Amazon Storefronts design services" width="1019" height="500" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1.png 1019w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1-600x294.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1-300x147.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6-1-768x377.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1019px) 100vw, 1019px" /></p>
<p>Do you see a professional website without an about us or customer satisfaction section? No. Then you’re your website-like storefront on Amazon should also not be without it. The main purpose of a storefront is to improve your brand recognition and emotionally-connection stories and the about us, the section does a great job of this. Every business has a story, a mission, a vision, and ethics. Dedicating a page or a section in your storefront for showcasing your company ethics or telling your brand story can effectively communicate your brand’s values and how they align with your potential shopper’s goals. If your products come with a lifetime money-back guarantee, or your brand is 100% sustainable, or you donate a part of your sales to charity, make sure the customers are aware of this. This will help the customer trust you as a brand more easily.</p>
<h3>4) Always Add Call Out/Shop Now Images:</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14792" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-2.png" alt="Amazon Storefronts design" width="1020" height="510" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-2.png 1020w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-2-600x300.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-2-300x150.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7-2-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" /><br />
Just like guarantee and warranty claims, call-out images are not allowed in A+ Pages. Storefront is your opportunity to do everything you couldn’t do in your A+ Pages. Instead of adding a simple grid, customize those images by adding a Shop Now icon, title, or whatever you want. Adding callouts in the banners and other images can take your shopper closer to the coveted Add To Cart button. Make sure to link each “Shop Now” image to their respective product detail pages, or else customers may get frustrated and leave your storefront forever.</p>
<h3>5) Add Category Page Links On Home Page:</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14793" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.png" alt="Amazon Storefronts" width="536" height="495" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8.png 536w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8-300x277.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px" /><br />
Whenever a customer is redirected to your storefront from any source, be it on or off Amazon, he will land on the home page. He might not bother to look at how many pages you have in your storefront, so it is necessary that you have a dedicated image for each category on the Home Page. Clicking on those images should take the shoppers on the respective product page. This makes it easy for the customer to understand the types of products you have further enhancing the buying experience.</p>
<h3>6) Create Separate Page To Show Best Selling &amp; Newly Launched Products</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14794" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-1.png" alt="Create Amazon Storefronts" width="1258" height="601" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-1.png 1258w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-1-600x287.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-1-300x143.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-1-1024x489.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/9-1-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1258px) 100vw, 1258px" /></p>

<p>Your best selling products deserve special respect and similarly, your newly launched products need extra attention. This is why you should create individual pages for both. Apple has used a similar strategy for its storefront and it was worked quite successfully. Just like a website has a section dedicated for best sellers and just launched products, make a separate page for them in your storefront too.</p>
<h3>7) Make The Most Of Your Lifestyle Images:</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14795" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10.png" alt="Best Amazon Storefronts" width="1348" height="431" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10.png 1348w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-600x192.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-300x96.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-1024x327.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10-768x246.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1348px) 100vw, 1348px" /><br />
There is no such thing as so many lifestyle images. If you have some lifestyle images left even after using them for creating listing images, A+ Content and Storefront, you can always use the gallery section. It is a highly versatile and most ignored section of the storefront. There are endless creative possibilities. You can add your product’s lifestyle images, <strong><a title="Amazon Infographic Images" href="https://www.estorefactory.com/amazon-photo-editing-services/">Amazon Infographic Images</a>,</strong> or a mix of both. Using such photos can help customers envision how it would be if they owned the product. Using a gallery full of life-like and enticing images will give a personal, human touch.</p>
<h3>8) Utilize Amazon’s Interactive Storefront Features</h3>
<p>In January 2020, Amazon rolled out some new exciting features that can make your storefront more interactive and engaging. Shoppers can interact with the content in some ways and this helps them connect better with your products. When shopper engages with your storefront, they are more likely to buy from you because they have committed by investing their personal time on your store page. Here are all the updates recently introduced by Amazon.</p>
<h2>Amazon Storefront 2020 Updates</h2>
<h3>#1: Shoppable Collection Images:</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14796" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11.png" alt="amazon storefront design services" width="664" height="558" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11.png 664w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-600x504.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/11-300x252.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></p>
<p>If you have rich product lifestyle images, then you should definitely use this feature when you create an Amazon storefront. Customers can hover and click on the featured image to get some necessary information such as product name, price, Prime availability, review ratings, and add to cart button. This simple yet engaging new feature will take your shoppers from inspiration to purchase in just a few clicks. You can make any of the product images shoppable, provided you have a lifestyle image. You can also place product collections and make each product shoppable.</p>
<h3>#2: Image With Text:</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14797" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12.png" alt="Storefronts design for amazon" width="1130" height="551" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12.png 1130w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-600x293.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-300x146.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-1024x499.png 1024w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/12-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1130px) 100vw, 1130px" /></p>
<p>A similar type of image is available on A+ Page and now it’s also available in Brand Stores. Sellers can add a text overlay to images and the location, size, alignment and color of the overlay can be completely customized. The overlay also features a prominent call to action button to improve conversion. Amazon states that using clickable text on images has been shown to improve the store’s search engine optimization, which in turn increases traffic from a third-party search engine. So make sure to use this type of image when you create a storefront on Amazon.</p>
<h3>#3: Bulk Product Uploading &amp; Out Of Stock Product Management:</h3>
<p>Previously sellers had to upload individual products to their product grid and featured-deals tiles. But now they can upload all the ASINs in bulk, which greatly reduces time and effort. Moreover, sellers will also have an option to automatically hide any out-of-stock products. This improves the customer&#8217;s shopping experience and reduces their frustration of being on a product detail page that’s not in stock. Maintaining and updating the brand store just got easier!</p>
<h3>#4: Stores Scheduling:</h3>
<p>Sellers can now publish their storefront for the first time or the updated storefront at the scheduled date and time. This allows you to plan ahead and align your brand store’s publishing with new product launches, brand updates and seasonal changes. Typically Amazon takes about 72 hours to review your storefront. While you submit for review, you can request a custom date and time on which you want your storefront to be live.</p>
<h3>#5: New Links to Amazon Storefront</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14798" src="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13.png" alt="amazon seller storefront" width="1017" height="335" srcset="https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13.png 1017w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-600x198.png 600w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-300x99.png 300w, https://www.estorefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/13-768x253.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px" /><br />
The new format of Sponsored Brand Ads makes it easy for shoppers to visit your storefront. Along with featured products, the ad formal also includes your brand logo, which a shopper can click and go to your store. Amazon says that it is experimenting with new ways for the shoppers to discover your storefront, which is why it is essential to upload a brand logo in the Store Builder. Upload now if you haven’t already.<br />
