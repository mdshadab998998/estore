From October 15 to January 14, third-party sellers enrolled in and using FBA will have to pay 35 cents per item sold in the USA or Canada. These extra charges will top off sellers' existing fulfillment fees for using FBA services.

<strong>Their official announcement read:</strong>

"As we look ahead and prepare for the busy holiday shopping season, we expect greater utilization of our fulfillment network. Across the supply chain, this creates increased operating costs during this holiday peak period.

As a result, similar to other major carriers, we will introduce a holiday peak fulfillment fee from October 15, 2022, to January 14, 2023. The fee will be an average of USD 0.35 per item sold using the US and Canada FBA."

In its defense, Amazon said they have "previously absorbed these cost increases," but seasonal expenses are reaching new heights. Sellers have been using Amazon's fulfillment services to shield themselves from the peak season fee hike charged by other carriers such as FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service. But with this new announcement, it seems like Amazon is passing on the burden of increasing operating costs to sellers. The company has already announced a 5% fuel and inflation surcharge in April after hiking fees in January.

Amazon has ensured sellers that despite the fee hikes, their fulfillment services remain 70% less expensive on average than comparable two-day shipping alternatives.

What is European Fulfilment Network (EFN)?</strong>

EFN allows sellers with accounts in Amazon Europe and registered in Fulfilment by Amazon to store their inventory in their local fulfilment centre and fulfil orders from all over Europe.
Post Brexit, it was difficult for UK sellers to sell in Europe because of logistics difficulties, custom costs and administrative burdens.

With the re-launch of the European Fulfilment Network, UK sellers will again be able to enjoy the convenience of EFN.

For all products you sell, Amazon charges a percentage of the total sales price. The exact amount depends on the product category you are selling in. Most referral fees can be anywhere between 8% and 17%.

Recently, the retail giant announced that sellers would get a discount of up to 25% on select ASINs. The main motive behind this is to drive sales of excess inventory and improve the seller’s cash flow and sell-through rate.

To access the referral fee discount, go to FBA Inventory and create sales or Outlet deals for eligible ASINs.

<strong>How does this work?</strong>
Your Manage Inventory Health report shows the listings with excess inventory and recommendations to improve the sell-through rate.

Sometimes, when sellers take suggested actions to get rid of excess inventory, Amazon will also benefit. In those cases, Amazon will pass the savings to sellers by offering a discount on referral fees for every unit sold when sellers adopt the recommended price and offer period. Discounts are at least 30 cents per unit, up to a maximum of 25% of the referral fee.

Since 2018, USA sellers enrolled in FBA program have been able to fulfil their orders Canada and Mexico using their US inventory without any added costs. This offered customers a better selection of products and sellers the opportunity to sell in neighbouring countries and increase sales. <br><br>

Over the course of pandemic, there have been significant investments made by Amazon to better serve its sellers and customers. Citing rising costs, Amazon has increased fees for sellers who use FBA program to send orders to the countries that border the US.<br><br>

FBA fees for a 6-ounce-or-less package delivering to Canada will increase from $7.22 CAD to $7.58 CAD. For a package of the same size delivering to Mexico, the fee will increase from $102.39 MXN to $122.87 MXN.<br><br>

The fees change with the weight of the package. For more information, go to <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G57UH6FFZUJ5DX3W&amp;ref=nslp_at_G7VNRE9DXK8UG4TT_en-US_nslnk_1" rel="nofollow">2022 Remote Fulfillment with FBA fee changes</a>.<br><br>

<p>Sellers have previously shared how difficult it was to keep track of order cancellation messages as they can be easily lost among multiple buyer-seller messages.</p>

<p>In order to streamline the order cancelation request process, Amazon has introduced the new experience for Buyer Requested Cancellations.</p>

<p>Cancellation requests will no longer appear on the Buyer-Seller messaging tool. Instead, they will appear in a banner on the Manage Orders page. Cancellation requests will also be seen in order reports once you enable the Buyer-Requested Cancel field.</p>

<p>The updates were initially supposed to go into effect in late April, but as there was a lot of confusion about how the new system would work, Amazon had to delay the effective date. The changes officially went live on May 23rd.</p>

<p>While this rollout occurs, you will receive buyer cancellations through the old experience on Buyer-Seller messages or through the new experience on the MYO page.</p>

<p><strong>Sellers could receive buyer initiated cancellations in the following methods: </strong><br />
&bull; Email: You will receive all buyer cancellation requests through email under the subject line of &ldquo;Order cancellation request from Amazon customer.&rdquo;<br />
&bull; Seller Central: You will receive some order cancellation requests through the Buyer-Seller messages or some through the MYO page.</p>

<p>If you find yourself too busy to manage the everyday tasks like replying to buyer seller messages and keeping a tab on order cancellation rate, hire an experienced <strong><a href="../account-management-agency/index.html">account management agency</a></strong> who can take these day-to-day management tasks off your shoulders.</p>

Merchants using "Buy with Prime" will be able to put the coveted Prime badge on all eligible products listed in their online store. With Buy with Prime, online sellers can also offer fast, free delivery to their shoppers without relying on other shipping services like FedEx and UPS. Amazon will charge a fee depending on the card processor and fulfillment complications.<br><br>

By introducing "Buy with Prime," Amazon is also directly competing with shipping services like FedEx and UPS.<br><br>

Buy with Prime creates a win-win situation for both: online merchants and prime members. Prime members can get the broadest possible selection, low prices, and a convenient shopping experience even outside Amazon. Online merchants can use Amazon's fulfillment network to seamlessly deliver orders. Amazon will also manage free returns for eligible orders.<br><br>

Buy with Prime is currently invite-only for merchants using Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), but we anticipate it will be rolled out to all online sellers very soon. If you're interested, you can register <a href="https://www2.amazonbuywithprime.com/join-interest-list">here</a>.<br><br>

The increased fees will apply to all product types, including non-apparel, apparel, dangerous goods and Small and Light items. <br><br>

Sellers who choose FBA as their fulfillment channel have to pay a variety of fees in addition to the fulfillment rate that's being increased at the end of April 2022. One of the sellers sharing their frustration with the fee surcharge said, "Also, an inflation surcharge is ridiculous. Prices aren't ever going to decline, so adding an inflation surcharge is silly time. It's a price hike, call it what it is. We're not stupid."<br><br>

The surcharge is in lieu of increased fuel, logistics and labor costs.<br><br>

"In 2022, we expected a return to normalcy as COVID-19 restrictions around the world eased, but fuel and inflation have presented further challenges," said the Amazon FBA team to CNET.<br><br>

There are changes in numerous services, including the following:<br><br>

• Launch of dim-weight pricing for large standard-size products excluding apparel<br>
• Higher monthly off-peak storage fees<br>
• Increase in removal and disposal fees (liquidation fees will remain unchanged)<br>
• Increase in FBA Prep Service fees<br>

Budget rules help advertisers efficiently plan and monitor their campaigns by setting budget specifications in advance. For example, you can set rules to increase the daily campaign budget on Prime Day, Black Friday, or even on weekends to ensure your campaigns don’t go out of budget and reduce manual effort spent on adjusting your campaign budgets.

<strong>There are two types of budget rules you can select from:</strong>
• Schedule-based rules will increase the campaign budget by the percentage you specify during the date range you set in the rule.
• Performance-based rules allow you to set rules to increase your Sponsored Product campaign budgets only when your campaigns meet a certain performance threshold.

<strong>How does it work?</strong>
The rule will increase your campaign budget by the percentage you specify during the date range you set.

<strong>How to get started with Budget rules?</strong>
Head to campaign manager, select the campaign you want to apply Budget rules to and select Budget rules in the sidebar.

<strong>Benefits of budget rule:</strong>
• Prevents campaigns from going out of budget, so your shoppers are still able to see your ads
• Get useful recommendations based on historical shopping activities, campaign similarity and marketplace seasonality
• Plan and set campaign budget ahead in holidays, sales events, or anticipation of higher traffic
• Save time &amp; manual effort. Let Amazon automatically increase your campaign budget

Leveraging this new feature can surely help you improve your PPC performance. Another way is to hire <strong><a href="../amazon-sponsored-ads-experts/index.html">Amazon PPC Consultants</a></strong> from eStore Factory. With us, you won’t have to worry about getting out of budget or out of your target ACOS ever.

These budget recommendations help minimize the chance of your campaign running out of budget. <br><br>

Why is it important to stay in budget? That’s because when your campaign goes out of budget, your advertised products won’t be visible in the search result pages. <br><br>

Today more than 75,000 products across the U.S. and Europe are seen flaunting this coveted badge.

Now Amazon is adding four new certifications to this program.

Once fully rolled out, the retail giant expects these programs to give more than 300 million products a second life each year. Prior to the launch of this program, sellers would have to call the inventory back or have Amazon donate the product on their behalf.

First is FBA Liquidations, where sellers can use Amazon’s existing wholesale liquidation partners and technology to prevent potential loss on returned and overstock items. The program is now live in the U.S., Germany, France, Italy and Spain, and soon the UK.

Selling partners in the UK can take advantage of a second program FBA Grade and Resell, which gives the option to sell returned products on Amazon as “used” items. It will be available in the U.S. by the end of the year and in Germany, France, Italy and Spain by early 2022.

Not managing FBA inventory efficiently can negatively affect your bottom line. You do not want to go out of stock but at the same time don’t want excess inventory sitting in FBA warehouses costing you money.

• Identify their top performing and most viewed products
• Identify the products that are missing from your Store or that shoppers are not finding (these products will show as having 0 views). To access insights about these products, go to the “views” column within the Product Engagement table and add the ASINs to your Store so shoppers can find them when browsing.
• View the products with highest engagement and sales
• Utilize critical metrics like click-through-rate and conversion ratio to understand the customer trends

Amazon Audiences offers thousands of pre-built audience segments to help your clients reach new prospective customers through awareness and consideration campaigns. Amazon Audiences is comprised of four targeting strategies, each informed by a variety of first-party shopping and streaming signals:

<strong>1. In-market:</strong> In-market audiences allow advertisers to engage audiences who are “in-the-aisle” and have been recently shopping for products in a given category. To capture share-of-mind, advertisers can reach audiences in the same category as their advertised products to drive consideration, as well as try out entirely new segments to help drive product awareness.

<strong>2. Lifestyle:</strong> Positioned for awareness campaigns, these audiences reflect a variety of aggregated shopping and viewing behaviors, including shopping on Amazon, browsing on IMDb, and streaming on Prime Video or Twitch. These behaviors reflect shared preferences and map to lifestyle segments such as “foodies”, “sports enthusiasts”, “tech enthusiasts”, and more.

<strong>3. Interests:</strong> Interest-based audiences allow advertisers to help raise awareness with prospective customers based on what they frequently browse and buy. Examples of these audiences include “interested in Canadian history” and “interested in interior design”.

<strong>4. Life events:</strong> Life events audiences give brands the opportunity to drive awareness and consideration for relevant products based around life moments, such as “traveling soon” for shoppers going on vacation.

Over the past several years, they have made numerous improvements to encourage purchasers to review products on Amazon.

As of March 5, 2021, Amazon will no longer allow new enrollments in the Early Reviewer Program and will stop offering the service to sellers currently enrolled in the program on April 20, 2021. You will not be charged for any reviews for enrolled products that are published after this date, and you will not be charged for the service if the program has not generated any reviews for your business.<br><br>

Recently, Amazon has launched a bulk image tool where sellers can upload multiple images together to the <a title="Amazon Product Listings" href="../amazon-product-listing-optimization/index.html">Amazon Product Listings</a>. Previously, you could only upload images and view the upload status for one product at a time. You can now upload up to 5 GB worth of product images at once with the bulk image upload tool and view the status of all your uploads in the image upload status report in Seller Central.

Every detail page in the Amazon store requires at least one product image, and we recommend you provide six images and one video. Good images make it easy for customers to evaluate the product. Images should be clear, informative, and attractive. The first image on the product detail page is the "MAIN" image and is shown to customers in search. The MAIN image must show only the product for sale on a white background, and the product should fill the image frame. Additional images should show the product in use or in an environment, different angles, and different features. Please note that video upload is a separate workflow. Search help pages to determine if it is enabled in your location.

This new feature gives advertisers using AT a frequently asked for optimization tool that allows them to negatively target a product detail page by ASIN, just as they would negatively target a search query by keyword.  The feature has launched for all SP advertisers in all marketplaces.

The control is now available in UCB, UCM, and the Advertising API. Prior to this launch, negative product targeting was only available for Product Attribute Targeting (PAT) ad groups.

<strong>Benefits:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Advertisers use negative targeting to optimize performance by removing ads from targeting when an ad-context (i.e. search term or detail page) underperforms when measured against some metric of interests such as conversion rate.</li>
 	<li>They also use negative targeting to protect their brand image by stopping their ads from showing on contexts that are not aligned with values associated with their brand. Advertisers have historically been able to see performance on product detail pages through the search term report for all targeting types and can see when detail pages are not meeting their performance expectations.</li>

What launched?<br>
Product targeting in Sponsored Display is now available for sellers in the US. With product targeting, you can promote product discovery with ads that reach shoppers who are actively browsing similar or complementary products and categories on Amazon, and access more campaign controls and reporting metrics to make your performance advertising strategy work more efficiently. Product targeting ads may appear alongside product description pages, customer reviews, shopping results pages, or under the featured offer. A modified version of Sponsored Display product targeting is also available for vendors worldwide.<br><br>

In the ads console, sellers will now be able to select from two options in the “Product targeting” field within the campaign builder.<br><br>

Advertisers can then leverage the product targeting widget to select one or multiple product page(s) to show their ads, select one or multiple categories/browse node to show their ads, and refine the category selection based on price, brand, star rating, Prime status, and other filters.<br><br>

Prior to launching their campaigns, advertisers can use the creative preview to see how ads will look like including a preview of any coupons or deals.<br><br>

Ad Placement<br>
Product targeting ads may appear adjacent to the featured offer and description sections within an Amazon product detail page on mobile and desktop. This gives advertisers an opportunity to be featured in a prime location and remain top of mind during the point of purchase.</p></div></div></div><div class="amazon-loop"><div class="card"><h5 class="card-header">Sponsored Display Ad Campaign &#8211; March 13, 2020<span class="green">Confirmed</span></h5><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">Getting Started Guide_SD Display Beta_Purchases_SearchesGet Started with Sponsored Display – a new self-service advertising solution for Amazon Sellers.

<strong>Customer returns tool</strong><br><br>

Amazon has added a tool to the FBA customer returns report page to give you greater visibility into reimbursements and customer returns. To quickly see whether you’ve been reimbursed, if you qualify for reimbursement, or if Amazon is still waiting for a customer return to evaluate:<br><br>

Go to the <strong>FBA customer returns report</strong><br>
In the <strong>Important Message section</strong>, click <strong>input the order ID here</strong> to access the tool<br>
Enter a <strong>Customer order ID</strong> to check your reimbursement status<br><br>

Important: Before requesting a reimbursement, review the <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/200379860?ref=nslp_at_3530823902482811962_nslnk_2_200379860" rel="nofollow">FBA customer returns policy</a>.(Login required)<br><br>

<strong>Amazon free replacements</strong><br><br>

Sometimes customers want a replacement for an item rather than just return it. With <strong>Amazon free replacements</strong>, customers can opt for a free replacement instead of waiting for a refund and then buying the same item again. Amazon ships an identical item (if available) from your inventory when a free replacement is requested.<br><br>

Note: When a customer chooses a free replacement, you will see the item deducted from your inventory and a sale for $0 on your <strong>Customer Shipment Sales</strong> and <strong>Payments reports</strong>.<br><br>

The customer has 30 days to return the unit (if possible), or they could be charged. Once the original unit is returned to Amazon, Amazon will evaluate it. If eligible for reimbursement, you will be reimbursed within 45 days of the customer replacement request.<br><br>

The seller can also copy campaigns that were not approved and can make necessary changes so that they can comply with Amazon's ad guidelines before resubmitting.

To copy a campaign in the campaign manager:
- Navigate to Campaigns.
- Click All Campaigns.
- Find the campaign you want to copy.
- Click Copy under the Action column for your campaign.
- Modify and create your copied campaign using the steps for your campaign type: Sponsored Brands, Sponsored Products, Sponsored Display, Lockscreen Ads, and Sponsored Products campaigns using custom text.

<strong>Note:</strong> Performance metrics such as impressions, clicks, and sales are not copied to the new campaign. Sponsored Products campaigns are generally eligible to go live as soon as you submit them.

Before changing the status of your listings, check for any pending orders, since these will not automatically be canceled. You might want to set your listing status to Inactive prior to the date you will be away, since pending orders may take time to resolve.

Along with the new name, which is now the same across both Seller Central and Vendor Central, Amazon has made several improvements:

Publish A+ to many ASINs at the same time, not 1x1 to SKUs - Before, sellers needed to submit A+ Content to one SKU at a time, including all the child SKUs in many categories. Also, sellers needed to deal with confusing differences about whether to submit A+ for a parent or child SKU. No more.

The new A+ Content Manager experience enables you to create a piece of content and search for and apply the content to many different ASINs - not SKUs - from different ASIN families. We also show you the image, ASIN title, and other information on the ASINs, not just the SKU like before.

Price Per Unit (PPU) information is used by customers to compare and evaluate products during their shopping journey. Amazon will be implementing the following data requirements for U.S. sellers.

1) Starting June 12, 2019, products sold within the U.S. Consumables product types listed below will require all new listings to include the unit count attribute, which was previously optional. Unit count includes a value (unit_count, e.g. "5") and a unit type (unit_count_type, e.g. "ounce"). The unit type will be restricted to the following units:

- fluid ounce
- ounce
- pound
- gram
- count

2) Data submissions without this information may fail. The scope of this change includes any product-level data submissions, whether through Excel templates, Seller Central, or XSD feeds.

3) Similarly, on June 12 products sold within the same U.S. Consumables product types will also require updates to existing impacted listings to include the unit count attribute. ASINs without unit count information or with invalid values in the unit count type attribute will still require this information when listings are updated. Any updates that do not include this information will be rejected.

Amazon obsesses over providing our customers with the best possible shopping experience. Since the inception of our store, one way we have ensured a great customer experience is by sourcing products directly from Brands and selling them to customers in our store ourselves. In order to preserve that customer experience, we may choose to source products from some Brands for sale by Amazon only. Other Brands can operate as sellers in the Amazon store if they can consistently maintain our standards for customer experience. However, to prevent customer confusion, if any of the Brand’s products are sold by Amazon, the Brand may not also sell those products as a seller in the Amazon store.

Amazon measures customer experience in a number of ways, including high in-stock rates, delivery experience, price competitiveness, and selection coverage. Amazon offers several tools and services to help you meet our standards and sell successfully in the Amazon store, including tools for inventory management and automated pricing, fulfillment services like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), and services to grow and protect your Brand like Brand Registry.

If sellers cannot maintain our standards for customer experience, they might lose certain privileges associated with operating as a seller in the Amazon store (including having their offers featured on product detail pages), or the seller might lose the opportunity to operate as a seller in the Amazon store altogether. In that case, sellers can still offer to sell their products to Amazon so that we can sell them to the customers.</p></div></div></div><div class="amazon-loop"><div class="card"><h5 class="card-header">New listing requirements for PPU Information &#8211; May 02, 2019<span class="green">Confirmed</span></h5><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">Price Per Unit (PPU) information is used by customers to compare and evaluate products during their shopping journey. Amazon will be implementing the following data requirements for U.S. sellers.<br><br>

1) Starting June 12, 2019, products sold within the U.S. Consumables product types listed below will require all new listings to include the unit count attribute, which was previously optional. Unit count includes a value (unit_count, e.g. "5") and a unit type (unit_count_type, e.g. "ounce"). The unit type will be restricted to the following units:<br>
- fluid ounce<br>
- ounce<br>
- pound<br>
- gram<br>
- count<br><br>

2) Data submissions without this information may fail. The scope of this change includes any product-level data submissions, whether through Excel templates, Seller Central, or XSD feeds.<br><br>

3) Similarly, on June 12 products sold within the same U.S. Consumables product types will also require updates to existing impacted listings to include the unit count attribute. ASINs without unit count information or with invalid values in the unit count type attribute will still require this information when listings are updated. Any updates that do not include this information will be rejected.<br><br>

<strong>The change will apply to the following Consumables product types:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>BEAUTY</li>
 	<li>BODY_CARE_PRODUCT</li>
 	<li>FRAGRANCE, HAIR_CARE_PRODUCT</li>
 	<li>HAIR_REMOVAL_AND_SHAVING_PRODUCT</li>

In the United States, a broad range of products are subject to regulation as pesticides and/or pesticide devices, including products that you may not immediately think of as pesticides. Any product or device that is either: <strong>(1) intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest, or (2) makes any antimicrobial, antifungal, antibacterial, or pesticide claim (each, a “Pesticide”) must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), including (in most cases) registration with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Some common examples of pesticide devices include:</strong><br><br>

Well in this case, here you go.<br><br>

So, how do you get the stock on hand of the product?<br><br>

- First, open the product listing of the ASIN you want to get the inventory for.<br>
- For example, let's take <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0797MMK8H?ref=myi_title_dp" rel="nofollow">Ir Illuminator</a> in USA.<br>
- Open the HTML Source Code of this page. Simply click the [CTRL]+"U" key combination, or use right-mouse-click and select the "View Page Source" menu item.<br>
- Activate the text search function on the HTML source page by clicking the [CTRL]+"F" key combination and search for the word "stockonhand" or "stock".<br>
- If the browser finds the "stockOnHand"/"Stock" word - look for the number next to it. This will be the number of units this product has in stock!<br><br>

Following our Ir Illuminator example - at the time of record, they were having 9 units in stock.</p></div></div></div><div class="amazon-loop"><div class="card"><h5 class="card-header">Amazon Live, New Way to Reach Your Customer &#8211; April 5, 2019<span class="green">Confirmed</span></h5><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">Amazon has launched "Amazon Live", a live-streaming platform for product demonstrations and one on one shopper seller interactions to further drive online sales.
